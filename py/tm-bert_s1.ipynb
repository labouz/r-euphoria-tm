          "be it just that your used to she act a certain way so you can t get into she act like she do in euphoria because I love she act in this show and many other do as well not just fan of it like those you d see in here but other that criticize tv movie for a living",

          "ned stark the north remember",
          "I also think she be pathetic and anoying that scene where she be scream and whine because her drug dealer will not open the dor be pitiful she come off as an ungrateful self absorb and imature little girl who try to blame all of her problem on someone else she have only know jule for a few month but think she be in love give I a break she need to grow up but instead she just throw a tantrum for no aparent reason while she break down cry because she think she have what she deem as a \" tough day \" it sem like she be stres out for irational reason over negligible issue in her life which she should just deal with like everyone else but no she be the center of the world and when thing do not work out exactly like she need they to she act out like a spoiled brat that same scene episode where she start cry in front of jule then proced to blatantly vilify and denigrate fez make she look pathetic and anoying instead of elicit any sort of sympathy from I quite frankly her reprehensible character be start to stres I out to much",
          "that would just make I hate the show like nar dude you don t just kill rue after season that be dog",
          "her naration sem to know everything relevant to the story regardles or not of whatever the character actually know those thing she also speak in past tense do you guy think she be dead maybe she be in purgatory or something maybe the god or whatever be decide whether to put she in heaven or hell just some theory would love to hear all of yal",
          "rue do say in the first episode voice over that she be not always the most reliable narator",
          "yeah that scene at the carnival sem so random like I never expect her sister to even care about that let alone talk lol",
          "probably likely because from what I remember no one else be in the room just rue so probably be just a dream sequence halucination",
          "no just no I think I would stop watch the show if this happen",
          "I just read the original script and woah I be like fucking shake lmao first off rue be describe so diferently sam levinson write it in so it be interesting how he change her character up a lot second if they actually go by this script the ending be go to be wild I be not ready",
          "I do not think anything happen to she I just believe she will become a more important character in season",
          "well she do say she be psychic I think that be the producer s way of get everything involve in the story",
          "I do think she be a col chick and very likable",
          "I suppose she could get alcohol poisoning at the end but survive and rue and her will split because there well off as friend",
          "sorry for my english sorry for the picture quality I kep wonder if the light here bright side shadow side on rue be for acentuate the bipolarity kind of reme I of nolan in the dark night kind of do the same for harvey dent two face to show the dark side of he slowly come out during the movie",
          "like honestly if they do a rue be dead the whole time twist it s go to take like star of my rating yknow that just wouldn t be a good twist at all just anoying",
          "the only reason I think she could make a good narator be because she may be able to have an objective opinion of everyone but that also may not be as fun as having rue tell an unreliable story",
          "be that in the script it look like other people be in the church with rue",
          "just out of curiosity why be she your favorite character",
          "hey got get sean bean and kill he after",
          "a lot of people be talk about how zendaya play mj and rue similarly but I think that they don t have much more in comon than any other two emotionaly close off tenager I mean the close mj have come to drug be bring espreso in venice it s definitely col drawing comparison but I stil think the role be a testament to zendaya s breadth as an actor",
          "I know we should wait until the season actually end before we get into the purpose of narative device but what do you think the point be of rue narating for everyone I know there be a theory float around that she be dead how I feel about that one be a mot point but what else do you guy think be the naration tactic helpful or limit would it be more fun to discover these character san naration or would go without it make certain plot point and shift in time hard to make sense of",
          "that s how overloked she be",
          "it would be trash if he end up as a shit person it would be anoying",
          "I do not think she be a bad person by any mean I just feel she enable a lot of people in her life high scholer be not as dumb as people think either they deserve a little credit",
          "she s to old and to be honest she isn t that great of an actres",
          "I m think it might be a flashback of some sort",
          "anyone here see the katherine langford paralel of reason why like make every episode for a different character perspective like she tell the story maybe she will die maybe she will od let s see",
          "also cos her carer be go to blast off any second and this show take a lot of time to film compare to movie",
          "so after rewatche the first few episode again something ocur to I in the very first episode rue explicitly state how she be not always the most reliable narator that lead I to think that a lot of stuff be show in the show be actually rue not know what actually happen and fil in the detail this could mean that everything that happen when rue be not directly involve might need to be take with a grain of salt any thought or idea",
          "well I say they ve heroic quality not that they re hero macbeth and othelo have heroic quality but neither be a hero but I do hope for rue and jule they re kid whose action mean terible risk but who have great promise also regard specific heroic quality there be many that might be consider but obvious candidate be rue s ocasionaly unspare honesty in spite of her sometimes calous behaviour and jule defiance in the face of all danger in spite of sometimes put herself at risk regardles of the consequence for her love one should thing turn nasty",
          "yeah when I see the church scene I got fuck up in the head think it be rue narating at her funeral when the episode be end we just see rue fade out of sight on scren",
          "I feel like rue be go to chase the high she get from the fetanyl I really feel like she be go to get clean and then fal off so hard watch her journey get clean and go back on drug be go to fuckin ruin I",
          "dead people say dep shit",
          "one thing I ve notice over the course of the series be that rue have some serious moment where she be an unreliable narator and her story contradict what actually happen point to back it up in the pilot she say explicitly she never experience any trauma but later we find out she watch her father die of cancer after he be suppose to get well certainly a traumatic experience in the most recent episode she say mckay enjoy date cassie because of the jealous look other guy give they however it s very aparent mckay be uncomfortable with cassie s promiscuity he tell she to cover up at the party re watch her old sex tape which be pretty weird now that I think about it fezco blatantly tell she that he doesn t believe anything a drug addict say because they re just look for an in the general dramatic lighting and camerawork whenever rue be high as well as the break from reality I e the dick pic clasrom lecture in episode the spining halway in episode also contribute to the idea that we re view event distort through her mind I m of the mindset that these be not plothole but rather deliberate choice make to give a sense of how rue perceive the world I don t know who she be talk to though I like the theory that she s tell all of this to ali over pancake though tl dr even though rue be introduce as an objective observer of all these event her naration and the actual storyline don t always match up take what she say with a grain of salt",
          "honestly be easy to mis if I have not watch zendaya do that same peak over in far from home the day before watch that episode I probably would not have notice she do it and therefore would not have notice what she be peak at and it very well could have be a different set I just put and together",
          "I think that she might have just be change into another bra and panty set",
          "pretty sure that scene be a flashback to her dad s funeral",
          "I hope this season wrap up every story line with rue die she have no redeem quality at this point",
          "I think that the most boring part of the show be the whole rue and jule part everything else that be go on with the other character be far more interesting to I",
          "the reason I suspect it be because of the imdb cast list for eps and she s not list in the main cast for those two episode which be sus if I remove that factor I do not see any plot base reason for her death",
          "I think its inevitably she ll die somewhere down the line aside from it make sense character wise and her nate be most likely to kick the bucket I just don t see zendaya stick around for more than a season or two if there be another which hopefuly by that time the rest of the cast become strong enough to hold it down without the big and arguably good actor I can easily see the story shift from rue to jule fez or even gia s perspective",
          "the show would be well without rue her character be underdeveloped compare to the rest I be a fan of the show and I have realize that the character rue be extremely boring we be six episode in with episode remain in the season and we know little to nothing about rue next season they should try a different aproach and center it around a different character the show should honestly be center around jule now once again I will say I be a fan of the show but I feel as though the show would be well without rue",
          "she be the girl who be handwrite the note to kat of daniel break up with she be in and we do not know anything else about she or what happen to she",
          "everyone on twiter be talk about rue getting fuck with her shirt on and I do not know what I see in those scene with hanah and na dick te and rue so I do not know bruh",
          "I have no idea she be in it didn t see the last one but that for sure make I want to see that one",
          "these show have wardrobe department so there be a lot of custom make clothing there will not necesarily be clothing straight off a rack that you can buy I wish you luck in find these",
          "even though it be super far fetched I personally believe the the voiceover thing to be somewhat like a himym type of thing where at the end of series or something they be go to reveal rue die or the \" end \" of her story because some of the thing she narate there be no way she would know of it happen until later in life she come full circle somehow whether she die or maybe become clean and learn the truth",
          "yeah no this whole show be center around rue and have be advertise as that fromnthe begining you can stop watch though if you re not get what you want",
          "when the girl be drive to the party madie see rue and say \" be that \" the girl in the back say either I do not like ghost or in afraid of ghost",
          "lmfao ema watson be a hilariously bad actres zendaya be truly a revelation for I I do not think she have this in her but act chop aside zendaya also exude a natural col and lay backnes that someone as posh and bland as ema could never",
          "right right I forget about the kid drug dealer damn that kid be slick if he stay outa prison he s go place maybe I should give episode one a full rewatch",
          "she be jud apatow daughter she be definitely go to have some story",
          "\" also in the second episode she be call a ghosthere be many reason for this everyone think she die \" rumourshe have not be aroundeither way say that she be dead because of this one thing be a great asumption I have read other theory as well and it all sound like people grasp at straw",
          "yeah if they want the show to not have a s for eg if zendaya get a big marvel role I can see that happen",
          "not spoil anything but there be blog that get to preview the series and go into detail about what happen in episode basically rue be a shit person",
          "I be sad to say this because I love zendaya just as much the next person do but I really do not think she be do a great job act this character now this be come from someone who do not act so I really do not get a say in this but I wish they have cast someone else there be just some scene where she do not do as well as her co actor be do nothing against he I be sorry everyone",
          "she be not be dead the entire season jesus christ people interact with her",
          "mom I think",
          "narate from death sem like a reachthe original israeli show end with the main character s death so it s not really a reach",
          "thank you for call she that lol she would apreciate it a lot",
          "and I swear to god if she be fuck that show",
          "I wouldn t say heroic but I would say they be absolutely act like real tenage girl my friend and I would always be pisy about another friend who be either crush or just start date someone and blow we all off it be a rotate fight al the time",
          "be I the only one that find this theory ridiculous it would literally ruin rue character to rue be not the type of person that would do that",
          "that be sean bean though he have to die",
          "I agree somewhat for example when she say cassie s dad get in his acident when drive home from work when he be actually drunk and leave a bar she either fil that in herself or be repeat what cassie s family make public",
          "damn good eye I will say that in the two shot with jule rue do not sem to be wear any makeup and the shirt look redish but it be really hard to tell with the blue filter all I know be this show be go to wreck I",
          "care kind trustworthy loyal",
          "I dres a lot like rue and have for year chunky shoe look no far than yru demonia",
          "I do not see how that scene show anything but ok I be stil not sure but use that scene as an example do not really make I believe that she like she but to each their ownedit so I watch the scene again on youtube which the scene oh my god it be so amazing I can not and I try to see what you be say but I only see that she try to pul zendaya s jacket down so",
          "ugh efy stonem be one of my favorite fictional character of all time I agree w what you be say but I definitely think we eventualy see the very dark tortured soul side of ef people always tell I in high school I remind they of her look wise and style she be my ultimate style inspiration",
          "consider she s jud apatow s daughter in real life yeah I d say it s a safe bet she ll get some camera time",
          "I feel the same she may try to kill herself or something because she feel invisible",
          "this be my first time see zendaya on any show they have get great casting director though hahaha",
          "obvi zendaya be first but I like to think they justify alphabetical with her first because she have no last name lol",
          "I love rue couldn t stand efy",
          "also rue mention that whenever she s high she begin to think that she s psychic which lead to I think that she tell these story base on what she have hear and then exagerate they a bit",
          "I think it would be weird but for I she be just one of those actor that completely become the role and you do not even remember she be act",
          "rue be pathetic wtf do you expect man she just od n be tryna get clean she also feel like she find someone n think she be in love",
          "someone say in another thread they think rue be testify in court which sound plausible to",
          "we all know rue wear her hodie and frequently pul the hod up in episode where she be be sober a couple week \" with \" jule \" happy \" she do not pul she hodie up jule on the other hand dawn a hodie and pul the hod up near the end of the episode madie as well when she walk into school her hodie be pul up do pul the hod up symbolize dark try time",
          "I feel like every episode regardles of who be the \" focus \" eventualy center around rue she be the main character",
          "zendaya be so subtly hilarious with her quirk to I love it great comparison",
          "that be the part I could not figure out since she be wear the hodie there be to much back and forth with the scene for I to kep up at first I be like \" oh this be the first time she oficialy spiral \" but then her hair be down and she have gliter on her face so I do not know",
          "now that it s be renew if she doesn t have an episode this season she ll definitely have one next season",
          "maybye it be just I but I feel like people be look into that one phrase to much like mabye she could have just mean she be biased in her thought or be just really fade so she can not really remember every single detail",
          "I don t have anything to add just want to say I agree with this post I think we re do with rule drama for the time be I m sure whatever happen in the finale will afect they but it s not go to be relationship drama anymore",
          "I just check again and I see that she be list in the main cast for ep and on imdb",
          "um there be a second season there be no show without rue so I be sure she do not die",
          "oh yeah yeah I totally agree I be just say she would have be a goo choice but the way they have it set up already be great",
          "yeah she would",
          "oh you don t want to know just watch a season recap on youtube you ll be entertain by how ridiculous it be then be disapoint that someone actually come up with that dog shit story",
          "I be late so it can not be just her voice because she acknowledge who she be when she say thing about how she be unreliable sometimes also I think in like the first episode she mention how some sort of story start when she met jule as if she be tell how something lead to something and it start when she met jule",
          "zendaya have a low voice doesn t help either lol",
          "yes I notice that roler skate next to the bed but I kind of forget about these young clip I love when smal detail like this be tie together this be so swet",
          "I doubt it base on the fact the show creator writer base rue off himself and he make it through his addiction irl I can t imagine it end in an extremely depresing way I think she ll recover eventualy or at least end the show in the proces",

          "I m so glad I m not the only one lol I have this huge atraction towards zendaya xb sometimes I get really confused I don t know if I m in love with rue or jule lol",
          "do not see the hype around rue she have the generic edgy rebel personality I have see it many time before and most that go wrong with she be her own fault so I can even feel sorry for her rue and jule have not get much chemistry whether it be the writing or act I do not know their relationship feel force",
          "I be sure this have be bring up before but could it be that rue be dead and tell we the story from above I do not know just a thought",
          "I think sam levinson pretty cleverly kep his option open with that final scene have the show not be pick up the ending stil would ve be ambiguous but yeah the interpretation that rue die in the end probably would ve become the prevail one but of course we already know the show will continue on and so will rue",
          "from death note do not know if it be just I but it be probably the darken eye and fast talking detective stuff that make I relate to it",
          "she even say herself that she be an unreliable narator to the viewer in the pilot episode",
          "sorry for my english sorry for the picture quality I kep wonder if the light here bright side shadow side on rue be for acentuate the bipolarity kind of reme I of nolan in the dark night kind of do the same for harvey dent two face to show the dark side of he slowly come out during the movie",
          "I be sure that this claim have probably be make already but here I go so I start to think that maybe rue be already dead my reasoning for this be that so far in every episode rue have be narate every episode herself this have lead I to believe that maybe at the end of this season we be go to see that rue be actually dead from an overdose and that this whole entire time she be be narate life event about herself and people around she that eventualy lead up to her death any thought on this again this may already be post somewhere else but I have yet to see it",
          "also the church scene might have be rue have suicidal thought I think imagine what her funeral would be like I do not think she die of the overdose it feel kind of cheap and I do not think she kill herself at the end I be not sure though",
          "and the visual representation of her anxiety with the stark spotlight and the whole real world shroud in darknes they do a really good job of show her feeling of the world close in on her and she not be physicaly able to see past the stres and presure she feel",
          "rue can frustrate and anoy I sometimes especially this past episode I do not like the expectation she have of jule and how she be basically frown about she the whole night it be a side of she that sem really selfish to I actually she might not be my favorite character even though I love all of the character in their own way except nate because he terify I like I sit on the edge of my seat when he be on I think lexi be pretty damn amazing but I think her loyalty to rue cause she to make decision that might not be in character but she stil do they I do not think she be a bad person at all and I think cover for your friend be a really normal thing to do at her age she clearly love rue in a way we have not see fully flesh out yet I do not think nate be anything else except for a psychopath and there be no excuse for I I do not give a crap what he find his dad do he clearly be more than just grow up with a mesed up family influence fuck up my most controversial comment be probably that the character of ashtray break my heart he be such a beautiful little soul and I feel so sorry that he be force to grow up so early and that this little kid be talk about drug and have a front in a hot dog shop he and fez they both seriously break my heart I love they both so much and I want well for they than the dangerous life of drug deal",
          "nancy rue",
          "and rue call herself a psychic when she be high before tell we nate s story so I think some of these fact be her imagination she state she be not a reliable narator so I think rue do make up some stuff",
          "yea I know she be obviously the one tell the story but I think literally anyone else would be well at it lol",
          "I do not think they be make it her fault the people warn she have just live life have more perspective and can see where the relationship be go they can see that rue be cling to someone who be probably not go to be permanent she be to desperate to listen she finally wake up in the finale",
          "I stil believe rue be dead she be not a direct representation of sam because she be not a man also in the second episode she be call a ghost",
          "aw I like rue lol she certainly have her flaw and be selfish and an addict but I stil see some good in her I do not think she be all bad she be just numb all her pain through drug because she do not want to know how to deal with reality plus I think all the character on that show be pretty selfish either way I stil ship they lol",
          "I think the season will end with she run away after posibly relapse overdose and realise she be hurt her friend and family to many time and decide to leave",
          "while rue definitely do not have plot armour I just would not see they kill she off in one season maybe in a future season though",
          "yeah I think I remember somebody actually say her sister find she on the flor I be just try to figure out if the od scene could posibly be flash forwards",
          "definitely I think it s when she first lose her virginity",
          "oh totally zendaya be go to be great in the new spider man movie I be not a huge fan of that stuff usualy but I be certain she will kill it",
          "they be dead all along have be the default theory that dumb people gravitate to for decade now it s the only thing they can come up with",
          "I do not like rue because she be always play the victim and for I that make she really anoying and she be always force her feeling on jule and I do not like that I find she extremely weak I can not empathize with she",
          "I don t think so because her makeup match and I didn t think that be how she od d the first time I could be wrong though",
          "do anyone catch at the end that juelz be tran in the bed scene with rue",
          "as someone have point out yes the biling be in alphabetical order",
          "that s probably what she ll find out in the finale",
          "I don t think there be any reason to believe she s dead or testify or any other theory as to how she can narate the story I think it s a poetic license that they use to tell the story and rue be the perfect character to do so it s the same reason she can break the fourth wall presentation scene about dick pic",
          "she could be narate in past tense because she be dead",
          "her eye makeup be the same as it be at the winter formal",
          "anyone else think she be about to jump from something in a suicide atempt the way the camera be angle up and she be look down nervously I think for sure she be stand on a bridge look down then the camera straighten and we see she be stand and texte ali it be such a cleverly shot scene and the emotion from think rue have hit rock botom and be go to try to end her life to she actually do the oposite and finally reach for help really make the scene have a heavy impact obses with this show and cinematography",
          "I like your thinking do not know about most compeling but she s def have some depth to she",
          "I and I can not stres this enough love her cynicism",
          "let we hope it happen soon I think they tease it with the fentanyl episode",
          "I think the spot light be her imagination halucination",
          "it be know as a ' lock down dril ' where teacher and student practice protect themselves against school shoter it be hi light just after her monologue relate to be bear just before and the shift in teen norm for the s",
          "maybe she be be dead the entire season at the end only her dad be able to see her who be dead her mom and gia could not",
          "I love the mention of she be an unreliable narator though anything else in particular you think she may not be tell we",
          "aw that s so like zendaya she s just an awesome actres I honestly feel like if I met she I would find she to be a great person",
          "I mean rue be the main character of the show the series be obviously go to have she have the most scren time of anyone the series isn t about jule it s about rue and her journey at the end of the day jule have so much scren time and have a tran actres play a trans character be amazing for representation her character be the focus of next week episode how be any of this transgender discrimination and as other have say rue isn t suppose to be likeable she s suppose to be frustrating and maybe you don t relate to the storyline which I respect but there be dozen of people who have say they relate and find find the story very reminiscent of their own experience which we also have to respect",
          "yes but I would not mind be wrong since I love rue",
          "yes it s just alphabetic order if anyone should get second biling on this show it s eric dane who have an establish carer yet his name come after angus cloud who be play his first role ever lol so yeah just alphabetic order",
          "its stil a relevant question to ask its not a typical character and the th wall be break but that do not answer whether her knowledge be an indicator of what happen plotwise or if its just a conceit of potetic license could easily be that she be dead or it could be that she be tell the story from year in the future or neither this show be definitely in the detail so I doubt something that big mean nothing at all",
          "I think she be refer specificaly to that night at the party",
          "I think the rue thing be a fake eulogy exercise that they probably do in na judge by the mom s different look it s most likely a flashback probably from right after the od",
          "ya but I be talk about the original od",
          "pan intrigue why do you think that",
          "I feel like this be bait rue be the main character she isn t suppose to be likeable even though to I she be every character in the show be there because in some way they be conect to rue and how can you smel her just because she have natural hair or what I can t even see how the show be transphobic I can use your logic and say you be racist because you think rue be disgusting which I bet you aren t such a weird post",
          "sympathy honesty atitude basically the whole vibe of the character",
          "some other people say that this \" inatention \" towards she be intentional probably to set up for she as a turning point for the show",
          "yeah but in the promo at the begining instead of present a character like in the other one there be rue s mum do a fake eulogy so I think it might be focus on she or a general episode on everyone like they use to do on skin",
          "true its not a perfect theory but I do not think rue would go all out in dicaprio s armor outfit from the film anyway lol",
          "I do not see it out of order at all she be narate as the show show we",
          "I really hope they just leave her character as a representation of the people you outgrow",
          "probably a rehab flashback",
          "zendaya be awesome the only reason I m watch at this point",
          "I doubt they will kill she off because she be such a huge part of the show but I do think that she will have to go back to rehab",
          "also I feel like rue have a very vivid imagination maybe it be because she sem like a loner and they talk about all of her anxiety also how she mention that first time the doctor give she a drug can not remember which one she say that be the first time her mind be quiet or something of that sort",
          "narate from death sem like a reach posible but not likely you don t secure zendaya as your lead just to kill she off after episode",
          "wow I never think about the naration I gues I asume that she know all these thing from rumor I can not remember time when curent event be happen and rue be narate what be happen in that scene that be actually really col to think about sad because I love rue but wow I have just be think about what will happen next and not where it be end off",
          "where do you read about it be base around her death",
          "yea I do not think she will die to much of an intriguing character",
          "I really hope they give we some true unreliable narator moment with she",
          "yea that would be kind of lame to be honest and I would feel like I waste a lot of time get into these character for no reason fez jule even gia right now our opinion of they be solely base on their relationship and interaction with rue so what would be the point if none of this dialogue ever take place",
          "no this be part of it to I think haha there be a gofines and a \" try to outrun time \" aspect about both of they",
          "yes why would they want to tie the name of the show in with finale and give we a visual representation of rue most likely overdose again completely shoehorn in",
          "one thing I have notice though be none of these girl ever take their makeup off like damn I do not know how you kep your skin so good",
          "I completely agree I really like she until the last episode the way that she play with rue s feeling be really rude I feel so sorry for rue and the fact that she she do a fake testimony to the police even if she be threaten make I les like she she could have manage the situation in a smart way",
          "to be honest I believe she be the narator tell the story of what she live see I think she be dead to",
          "rue create cp",
          "I definitely think that the show be foreshadow an eat disorder in rue",
          "picture to the sex scene with rue and rando fuck boy that s what he s credit as that be cut from the pilot and instead will be in this sunday s episode",
          "yo imagine rue jule and fez just sit on your shelf look all euphoric there d be so many style they could go with but I d buy that shit in a heartbeat hodie rue would be low key fire",
          "I would like to see she go detective mode a lot more next season maybe a little in the finale if it make sense",
          "I think it s just another overdose there s no way they re write the protagonist out of the show",
          "I be say to my husband that rue and efie be really similar character rue sem more vulnerable though more real",
          "rue be a shity person all she care about be herself and drug",
          "it be a dumy make to look like her even wear the same tracksuit we will see she in this sunday their makeup artist post it to she insta a while ago",
          "you just blow my mind completely forget she say that",
          "I stil love they together because hunter and zendaya s on scren chemistry be fucking explosive but I agree",
          "trufax it will be interesting to see how their relationship go forth from the first two ep it look like he will help she enable her drug trip up to a point but who know I know I would be heartbroken if he just give up on she",
          "pretty sure it be a fake eulogy they be renew for s they need the main character to move on with the story because no one else be really build up enough to be the new main fez make it out of next episode sem unlikely though",
          "rue be not a catch either though be honest",
          "but those be thing she could find out about or make up thing to fil in the blank whereas a secret visit from her friend s father be kind of a big thing to make up if we can make the rue naration work with her character I think it s worth the fun of figure it out",
          "rue be go to overdose and die when jule break up with she and she be narate from the great beyond that be why she know all the detail about the character",
          "fact I have never be this atach to a tv show zendaya be play her role perfectly I be go to",
          "like jon snow",
          "I also think it be weird in episode at the very begining right rue say sometimes when I get really high I think I m psychic and then she start tell nate s story I don t recal she start anyone else s naration like that probably nothing",
          "disagre I do not think the scene be mean to be a literal halucination but rather a pek into her mind",
          "sam have big plan for she in the next season and I don t know if anyone else have notice this but the only two character in the to have break the fourth wall be rue and lexi",
          "they can introduce all they want rue be a text bok unreliable narator because her perception of reality be distort by the amount of information she have by the fact that she s a proven liar op s on the money and viewer should never trust a character word but only their action",
          "for that she need to learn everything about every big character s past I don t feel like she have a great friendship with most of they something would have to happen for she to know all character that dep and how unrealistic would it be I mean she d have to learn about clasie s and mckay s first time and that s just not something that someone would tell a mere acquaintance",
          "hopefuly but why do they have to do he like that in order to get his back story smh",
          "rue be an excelent character well write and very well play perhaps you yourself be have trouble conect with the character and her story which be ok not every character will be equaly likeable to everyone there be some character that I definitely would rather they cut out of the show p but just like in real life you got to take the good with the bad lolfor I rue be the most important character because her life decision and habit reflect mine in many way so there be an imediate conection",
          "to I right now I think the finale scene be a flashback of when she overdose to I it feel like rue not go with jule be symbolic of she put her addiction aside for her family but that doesn t make as much sense if she relapse right afterword",
          "I know rue be wear a gosha tee when she be get her drug",
          "he s only post what happen in the israeli version can t come up with anything about the other character because they re all different",
          "yeah I be wonder why they bring it up at the very begining of the season then not have anything else even though it sem like a big part of her character and it hasn t be touch on since then",
          "consider she tell we stuff that she say even her own character do not know the whole nate and jule thing I do not know if she be unreliable or just narate without try to explicitly spoil thing",
          "I think its posible she change into it when she get home consider the her emotional state and the meaning behind the hodie",
          "I m with you on this I also notice the scene be grainy I think this be rue playing detective hence the outfit lol maybe she ll be spy on nate the promo also have new scene of the time when she help jule take her nude so I m think rue will put and together and find out what s go on betwen they",
          "I honestly think rue be dead I m do a re watch but there s a line that she say that make I really think she s tell the story from when she be alive I don t want to think this of course but she be an unreliable narator may be because she s a drug user so her perception of thing be distort",
          "hand down the happy moment rue fondly conjure from the sumer with her mom and sister that end in melancholy that scene just break my heart and make I rot for rue so much more despite her flaw because there be so much godnes and light in her see how much her sister love and look up to her I just want she to be ok and beat her addiction but I know it be only up to rue to make that choice for herself",
          "rue be probably the most developed character who do you think be the most develop character on this show lol",
          "through be pretty much guarante and be maybe would tie into somehow I really really don t want and to happen both because I really like rue and don t want to see she go through that again and because I think it s a little predictable a path to take",
          "it didn t happen you just read the israeli version online and try to spoil it for clout like a little bitch not mad just disapoint that bitch like you exist",
          "while rue be tell we her story we see a scene where we can hear attention student light go off they be sit in some kind of school s basement and a guy be watch porn what be happen",
          "if this show adhere to the series that it get inspiration from thing be not look fod also how do she know everything",
          "it be mean to emphasize how depresed she be literally to depresed to shower wash her face for day",
          "she already sign for season two so unles she be go to come back as a ghost I be pretty sure she do not die",
          "this scene fuck I up I think she do not understand the line betwen friendship and romantic love but stil it hurt to watch",
          "I completely agree there be so many aspect of different character life that I can directly relate to I can not even tell you how many time I watch the trailer and try figure the plot out lmao",
          "at the end of the series yeah honestly I see that she will lose fez probably at the end of this season and jule will also probably die a season or two before its end and she will believe she nothing leave to live for and probably will overdose and not come back this time",
          "okay so we all agree that she s be do such a phenomenal job on this show and some of her standout moment that people talk about most be break down at fez s dor apologize to jule in her room fight scene with her mom etc those be all amazing but when you look at she in her quiet moment I notice that she sometimes do this thing where she twitch her mouth ever so slightly kind of like a nervous tic you can see this in episode at and and in episode at in the interview I ve see with zendaya she doesn t normaly do that just a little detail I ve be notice and I think these little moment deserve so much more recognition because she have build such a nuanced and particularity to rue that I find be so intriguing about she",
          "my boyfriend first point this out to I after the scene in episode where rue saunter up to the girl car and say \" why thank you \" I find this hilarious when I notice it again in episode when she finese she na paperwork getting sign and say \" pleasure do business with you \" anyway else see these little quirk",
          "yes she do",
          "I be not sure but throughout the whole pilot I do not see rue eat fod well I mean every character do not have a scene eat fod but in the begin scene as a kid she be see look in the miror push her stomach in try to look skiner and before she leave for school her mom ask she if she eat fod I be wonder if they be kind of hint at an eat disorder or if I be just let reading to dep into this situation",
          "I be asume the rat mouse emoji that the poster put here indicate that rue will be rape by mouse in this episode I could be very wrong and I hope she doesn t but I gues we will find out in about hour what ever do happen o",
          "because she s a fucking genius",
          "not this hbo version but the original version I do not remember all the detail but I think the article I read say that the israeli show be base around the main character s death but again never fact check that or look into it any far so I could be completely wrong",
          "people be take this whole second biling thing way out of proportion algae smith and sydney sweney be borderline peripheral character and they get much more story depth and screntime than maude biling order do not equal story significance or screntime",
          "I do not understand why everyone be say rue be go to be dead by the end of the season zendaya have confirm that rue be base off of sam levinson s life which can most likely mean rue get her life together and become sober",
          "nah highly doubt it rue s story rue s show",
          "it would not make sense to kill rue because she be a reflection of the creator of the show and he be very much alive lol",
          "zendaya make the show she be amazing",
          "who call her ghost why",
          "yeah I know just wish they have chose one of the well character to focus on",
          "the show would be well without rue her character be underdeveloped compare to the rest I be a fan of the show and I have realize that the character rue be extremely boring we be six episode in with episode remain in the season and we know little to nothing about rue next season they should try a different aproach and center it around a different character the show should honestly be center around jule now once again I will say I be a fan of the show but I feel as though the show would be well without rue if you feel diferently about this by all mean please change my mind",
          "no why every time a show get a narator they always dead I honestly think your a fucking idiot that be chase clout on reddit",
          "in particular for I the scene of she on stage try to talk about her sumer her ask jule not to be mad at she in ep and she yel at fez through the dor be all so good I tear up at all of they",
          "I be think it will go in that direction or rue will od again and be hospitalize I hope it be the former to be honest",
          "rue sem like someone who would make a great lesbro once she get her addiction and mental health issue sort out",
          "I agree though I think that since base on what he say at atx festival rule sem to be base on sam levinson and his wife s relationship what will probably happen be that they ll grow into a more adult version of their curent dynamic",
          "I agree with you but oh my god now I m desperate to figure it out do this align with she be the all know narator be season two go to be without her I m stres tf out",
          "well zendaya s awesome but there be other character who re like steam train I be go to jule kat nate and maddy be obvious example but cassie s a slow burner I be go to and lexi and gia have scope",
          "they do I will never forget ned stark",
          "trust I I love a sociopath for year and year and year even know the truth love sometimes suck mainly when you be",
          "she need a narative purpose she s in every episode but we only get a single scene with her maybe a quick shot to but that s it we know a few thing she have no friend episode rue say they grow apart but lexi say in the bathrom rue be her good friend ep she s by herself during the pep rally ep when cassie be get ready she s do homework and disconect from the group lastly ep we see her left stand alone when jule and rue conect and gia leave to see her friend she s a hard worker we get this in her episode scene mention above maybe she feel presure to suced so be under stres no romantic relationship she might not get attention from boy because her sister be cassie home life isn t great her mom s an alcoholic no father that we know of I think she ll maintain one scene per episode her death will be end of ep or begining of ep she ll be the focus of ep her death will reflect how suicide s unexpectednes because we be self absorb but if you look you can see the sign sign that her family clasmate and we the audience ignore",
          "I do not know if you all remember but right before the drug dealer come to his house rue see something in the other room like a lady sick in bed hospitalize I wonder if they be go to explain it in the next couple episode what do you guy think it be his mom maybe just something I be think about",
          "exactly like I think he have be make to sem nice and loveable so when he crack it will be surprising thank for remind I of the foreshadowing",
          "do anybody else get the feeling this season be go to end with rue overdosing on fentanyl",
          "she s not that be just a fake eulogy exercise that happen at na sometimes",
          "I would say she be pan",
          "i d say rue be bi pan but only because that s the more likely plot for they to go for",
          "I have a feeling that ali be relate to rue maybe an be uncle it s posible ali have hear of rue and her situation through other family member he be try to be a part of rue s life the reason he have not identify himself as a family member be because he doesn t want rue to withold information in fear of intra family gosip and make he sem like he isn t well intend a reach maybe ali reach out to rue specificaly and know she be bulshit ali and rue be one of the few relatively healthy interaction betwen unrelated adult and tenager in the series ali sem to have good intention and be no nonsense about how he talk to rue he do not really inquire about rue s upbringe likely because he already know he be only interested in her present state and her recovery in their first conversation though it be likely he know the sister thing would get to rue ali know about gia as well ali know what kind of pain gia go through feel free to share your thought and to disect my theory I could be wrong this could be a reach but this have be on my mind",
          "I like it skin be the oposite rue and efy be pretty similar in my opinion yet in skin we only ever see the good part of efy s drug life the only time they show she in a negative life be when she be in the hospital for psychotic depresion",
          "yeah that be the one I have not watch it but if it have no resemblance then that make I feel well she might be dead because she be the narator though",

          "I just want to point out that it s freak awesome that rue should be such an explosive and provoking character give her storyline but really she s the baseline she have a sympathetic story and her choice may evoke anxiety for the viewer in the moment but really at least one episode in as hard as her trip and high be she feel steady predictable timeles the same reliable almost even though she try to imply that she isn t when it come to storytele flat and observe she move we through the world of euphoria in the same pace and monotony she s come to find comfortable with her own elixer of drug and detach sense of belong as much as we can t let ourselves agree with how she get through the day we take comfort in her cycle as much as she do which give the other player that absolutely have a story to tell the chance to do so as colorfuly and realisticaly as posible only rue could be the fade out we all forget in high school and at the same time coax our attention through the story so efortlesly",
          "that there be go to be something that change this whole show and the pov in the first episode I think rue say something along the line of \" I be not always the most reliable storyteler \" and so I think maybe this be embeleshishe or not the full truth I do not know but maybe someone do unveil one detail which open up everything else and make everything make sense also why do rue know everything about everyone be she omnipotent or be there some underlying truth frankly I hope this do not happen because that be like that whole ' be in a coma and dream ' kind of thing but you never know",

          "I find a link to she in another thread watch a ton I highly recomend as well",
          "I do not want zendaya to leave the show and I really do not want rue to die I hope that the \" funeral \" scene be something she imagine and think of when she be about to do something instead of be the real deal",
          "I like how it be leave ambiguous same outfit from when her dad die but dance makeup it really highlight the cycle of substance abuse can not wait for next season will we see rue recovering again or stil use I be not sure her family can so easily dismis her behavior this time though I hope",

          "I think this show be suppose to focus on each character rue s character be unlikable anoying and quite frankly ofensive to people who go into rehab like I seriously I could smel her and why be a great character like jule overshadow by rue she be the real star of this show this be discriminatory against the transgender comunity and for those of you defend zendaya you be a part of the problem",
          "just because the same actres character be narate a story do not mean they be the same an in story character as the narator help the audience to relate well to the character especially the main character",
          "thank you I think she be amazing I be so glad she exist",
          "I think your a fking idiot if you feel that way go dig out the last time she be on scren and have a field day if ema watson be in this show I wouldn t have watch it because nobody want to watch that shit show every week",
          "I think in this episode like the first one the focus will be on rue",

          "people kill for love themselves or other",
          "I could see that but she s a step below rue jule and kat in term of significance and a step above roy troy she s kind of free float and I think it matter",
          "good point I do not think about that like her narating be separate from she as a character",
          "I agree and I do not think she die but it also would not be uncharacteristic of hbo to find a way to incorporate a character who \" die \" in an early season into later season bl get etc",
          "that be fine it be just not how the person play the character be interpret it",
          "that s my interpretation that s why I don t watch cast interview I rather watch and make of it what I see",
          "join the club aside from my insane atraction to zendaya I can imagine myself back in the day be so very head over hel for someone like rue edit I be not the most emotionaly stable person back in high school early s and emotional savior complex be so on brand for I I would have totally try be rue s savior and smother she with afection and atraction it would have be embaras really",
          "so rue relapse when she be do the line on her bed she have the same exact makeup on",
          "the outfit though yes but these scene look really grainy and film like in comparison to the other which remind I of the dick pic scene which make I think it be another scene similar to that something in her head or another fake scenario type thing where she be plot some kind of revenge or explain something they have do a few scene like that so far so I do not think it be to much of a stretchbut I could also be way off I have watch this promo to many time try to put the piece together",
          "also to bum people out more there s a shot of young jule bang and scream on a locked glas dor at a hospital facility so I m gues the flashback will probably be about she in conversion therapy",
          "this be a step up from when they go gangster on the kid last episode lmao",
          "anybody else get really anoyed at rue s mother in the very begining when she interupt rue s count the square on the ceiling light there be this pathological need in some parent to constantly control or be imediately inform of their young child s every thought obviously there be more to it but I relate so much to young rue in that scene I have mild ocd and as a young kid counting activity visualy group thing etc be comfort for I there be a time and place to try to understand what you perceive to be your kid s od behavior if it not hurt they or someone else or obnoxiously disturbing in the moment let they continue finish and then have a frank discusion with they",
          "and rue do explain about herself in time soo",

          "it be so weird seing zendaya in that role now she be just rue to I now something just feel off to I and I would not have feel it if I never see euphoria I think that say something about how powerful zendayas performance in euphoria be",
          "that most relatable character for I",
          "it s posible but I doubt zendaya would do it",
          "it s also the name of a pornstar",
          "so far yes I really think she end up get scren time to flesh her story out but she be overlok so far be definitely intentional and part of the build up to whatever happen with she",
          "I m not on board with rue relapse that be most definitely her flash back to the past right after her father die fast forward to the begining of the first episode fast forward to the end of the finale aka the music video",

          "I think it might be like how I met your mother in that you will just see the unreliable narator apear subtly in smal way instead of some big reveal it be more likely we have to infer where she be talk creative liberty",
          "I hear a rumour that rue die in the finale it ultimately didn t sem like that but watch the episode be an absolute emotional rolercoaster so many scene loked design to be a eulogy and with rue s life flash before her eye when they rol out the body I think it be gia look at rue s body not rue look at her dad s",
          "I actually think she might have a near death experience but not really be dead like a clinical death heartrate and breathe stop but then she come back it d explain the death like experience of have these vivid halucination and be able to interact with her deceased father the chest compresion choreography the bright light that she look to but then fal away from and would have be foreshadow by the I hear she die that begin the theory then when people say I hear she die next season sudenly acurate rue clinicaly die but be resuscitate just my own theory anyway",

          "notice how I say \" some \" so if you see this post and get tick off you probably should not unles you be one of the people do this even then it be not a big deal it be just smth I would like to adres and talk about go around on this sub I have see a decent amount of \" rule \" shiper some people who acknowledge their ship be a mess but stil like they together other a lil bad I be not bulshit you when I have see someone make a post where they say they be more than earthly being or some shit and that even if they be no long together their relationship will stil live on in a metaphysical place as someone who do tarot and believe in ocult stuff even this make I laugh I be not try to be harsh like it be col and all but cmon now lol let we come back down to earth a lil bit then there be the people who be a lil les extreme than that like the one who think they will make it through their toxic way and that one day they will be free of this shit and end up together you know this be not the first time I have see people say thing like this about an unhealthy ship and it be just kind of sad to see because you can just sense idealism from the comment and it kind of remind I of when rue be make that spech in na about how she hope ali be not right about she and jule not be together forever people say that they be \" far more \" than their codependency even though that be how their relationship start and that the rot of it and can I just say that people say this as if codependency be a thing that can not exist betwen two people who love each other as if it be a thing they feel force to be in without love and that be it and that be not true even couple who be codependent first start off healthy but later down the road it start go south not even jule and rue be that some people have to acept what ali say and just take note high school be not forever hence the word \" some \" I know most of you all know this I just like refer to this bcus ali foreshadow a lot of rue and jule fate even if it be not happen now most toxic relationship problem start be solve when the two split up but they learn from each other it be ok for toxicity to end and it be okay to move on I do not know how people think that rue can continue on in this relationship when she sek out jule because she be a replacement for the drug she take and I be talk about the people who think they can stil be in this relationship and then just get well over time which no they have to have space from each other and I do not say that to mean she just do not care for her but she be the very reason as to why she be off of they right now and that be not good in any way shape or form no matter how you spin it to look good I also just feel really weird when people say they \" need \" each other almost as if they be validate the codependency it be just interesting they do not \" need \" each other what they do need be to sort their own shit out before drag other people into it they can not be in this relationship and function it just be not realistic or logical I feel for they I honestly truly do but they need to break up this relationship be hurt they both and it be to depresing to see especially since we do not even see they do cute couple y thing all we see now be self destruction self destruction and oh look what be that even more self destruction not to say that they do cute couple y thing would make it any well it be just hard to remember why I like the pair when I just see dreary thing even if they do split up and never contact each other again that do not mean it be all for nothing that do not mean their bond be not something special or great it be nothing about that change that you can stil view back on a relationship that go sour and stil be grateful that you even get to met a person like that that you even get to be apreciate by someone like that I have to stop talk to a guy friend of mine bcus his sarcastic natue and rudenes exhaust I that later be kind of aim at I but even to this day I be so motherfucke proud he get to be a friend of mine since I stil think he be one of the col dude I have ever met that be say it be bafle how people forget rue s drug addiction and think that this relationship will not crush she whether it be platonic or romantic I honestly do not know how some of you all think she can \" work through \" this relationship when this relationship be her new addiction if some of you all want she to be her healthy self then she need to let jule go edit since I see that a lot of you all know who mac miler be then I asume you pretty much know he be in a relationship with ariana as a former stan of her I remember the day where he be on her snapchat gof around and how he comfort she throughout the manchester incident she stil have to break up with he she even say they have a toxic relationship due to he stil use drug you see that be truly a great pair both of two people who suport each other through their dark time that relationship will always be valid that relationship will always be meaningful to ariana personally but they stil have to go there separate way for the well it be kind of sad since it take I a long time to just stop and acept the fact that they could not be in each other s life anymore but that be the reality of it jule and rue s situation be not just a few thing they can clean relationship where there a few eror to fix be one that have the two people have por comunication one person feel like they be not get enough attention or some harsh word be throw about those be thing that couple or friend can come out of but relationship where the sole reason it even exist be bcus of codependency be really really hard you know it be sad type this out bcus I would want to go on believe they will eventualy have this beautiful relationship where rue do not have to rely on she be sober but yeah",

          "yeah like every time I see rue smile with she it mess with I because like if you think throughout the show how often do you see she happy her face be always emotionles she be always zone out then jule come and she be her knight in shine armor like I feel that I be the same way",
          "I feel like since the begining rue have a romantic interest in jule which be not reciprocate and I have a feeling it would come up but not so soon in the series",
          "yeah I think she be stres because of the nate threat to she get upset when rue kep mention his family at lunch jule have not even tell rue about it yet which imply that jule might be to scared to tell anyone about what happen she cry in the bathrom because of it I do feel like rue be go to find about the nate situation though before the season end maybe jule will tell she or something else happen I feel like if they comunicate a little more with each other it will make their potential relationship a little easy but jule do not want to let anyone in right now she be stand ofish last episode and do not trust rue right now",
          "I really like rue s character but the way she s act around jule just bother I jule just want to have fun and have a friend and rue be just force a romantic relationship on her and now jule be go to have to break her heart and feel bad for send rue into another spiral when it s all rue s fault to begin with",
          "some post and comment mention that she speak in past tense be because she may be in jail and give a story of all the action cause influence lead to she be in jail other have mention that she speak in pat tense especially for jule that jule may be dead I do not know if I agree with this but it be a good thought and other have sugest that perhaps she be dead I think these group of friend have be very close with one another at some point in their life plus I would not be surprised as I and I be sure all have experience this but perhaps kat tell a girlfriend and she tell she girlfriend perhaps rue use to be good friend with all of those girl boy maybe she be friend with fez before sell drug and her drug be what isolate she and now she be tell the viewer how she get to wear she be",
          "yeah but also that be how they feel about each otherthey genuinely sem like sibling and if they get together I would feel kind of weird about it because I personally think the chemistry they have be purely sible like",
          "I think that jule feel a lot of presure since she s the reason rue be stay clean and be stres that she could potentialy screw rue recovery up however I can see where jule could be straight the date app cal and tyler I hope that jule realize how much rue truly love she and she doesn t run away or that they at least figure out where they stand",
          "I think it have more to do with depict the closenes of a codependent or otherwise emotionaly intimate female friendship at least that be what I hope they stick with I be not oposed to the idea of they end up together but I think that would be lazy of the writer female closenes in a one on one friendship be raw beautiful and rarely on display in the medium with the exception of girl and barely broad city as someone in a close female good friendship it be something I would like for they to explore without have to cros such a predictable line there be plenty of character that already give off quer energy but I hope they kep the bond betwen rue and jule platonic that be just I though",
          "I get what you mean it s sem to I like before rue od d she and lexi be close but since come out she hasn t try to reach out to she unles its when she need something while I enjoy rue and jule together as friend I feel like rue may have latch onto she because jule be a fresh face and didn t judge she",
          "I agree jule be pretty much the runer up as far as main character she have just as much screntime as rue however the show be about addiction and drug and jule doesn t struggle with either",
          "this be definitely a posibility but I will feel that it will end up be become toxic for either or both party",
          "do not get I wrong I have be in a few relationship but none where I feel that crazy or none where the other person make I feel like we be the only two people in the world either way I love their relationship and how real it feel it just kind of break my heart that jule may not love rue as much as rue love she",
          "yeah I mean I don t want to rain on anyone s parade but the show sem to be push for rue and jule a lot even cast member be openly say they ship it even though the storyline sem troubling for they I don t think they re go to make rue move on to someone else that quickly xb also if they want lexi as a potential love interest for rue she need to get more than just line per episode lol maybe in the future but right now sem to be just a childhod friend reconecte thing",
          "to answer your question jule say she didn t top to one of her grindr hok up I gues like you say we stil don t know what jule s preference would be especially if this be her first relationship with a girl we don t even know how rue identifie either and if she would be wiling to be top in the conventional way or even go down on jule",
          "I mean its fair to say jule be a bitch to rue while stil think she be a decent person jule be intentionaly lead rue on despite know her issue",
          "so there s only around hour leave for the next episode and I feel like jule have these many spiky moment over she and rue s relationship may be they foreshadow a future breakup or that jule be hide something big than tyler also the scene of rue crying in the trailer for episode I love the show the character and everything about it rue and jule hold a special place in my heart during to my love for the actor in part especially zendaya see rue fal back down to misery might be something I can t handle especially see how far she s come I hope all go well for her in other news I m super pump for season hope they don t ruin the great flow they ve got go on and maybe we can petition for the episode to come out fast than once per week",
          "do anyone else think lexi act weird when gia mention that she think rue be in love with jule like maybe lexi like rue as more than a friend maybe I m read into thing way to much",
          "yes except I wonder how oblivious jule would be she be every smart and very sharp it feel out of character thus far for she to be that oblivious",
          "interesting theory now that I consider it they may be kep her scene at a minimum so we have enough time to know she be there to but not enough to the point where we be so focused or atach to her character plus it would be a shock yet also saden as lexi have prove to be one of the more sane quiet kid from the show",
          "it sem that when rue and lexi kis rue realize that she enjoy it while lexi be weirde out by it",
          "a world alone rue and jule together hold hand",
          "on the late episode when rue and jule hug at the park you see her sister and lexi talk about it and lexi just brush it off like she do not want it to be a big a thing and we be talk about it on discord and maybe lexi have some feeling for rue could this be a thing on the future just wonder what other think also feel free to join the discord stickie in the front page to come and talk about the series with we",
          "I agree I m surprised that what people be take from this episode be that rue only like she as a friend to I it sem clear that their issue right now be jule kep the nate secret and feel responsible for rue stay sober but like op say hunter kep talk about jule be in a quer relationship and ster away from man so yeah I think she want to be with rue she s just scared of hurt she for whatever reason and make she go back to drug",
          "it s nice that while they might usualy be comic relief when a duo neither be really comic relief character",
          "maybe it be obvious but do the character in the show know that jule in transgender I sometimes get the feeling they do like when nate say he know what she be but it be stil so vague I be not sure if it be comon knowledge within the show and if they do not know I wonder how if that will change her relationship with rue which obviously have its own issue with rue codependency and all",
          "I feel like jule do not see rue like that so I really be curious as to where their head",
          "you have a point she have only demonstrate interest in man on the show so far however you can t asume she be straight that be say I do not think they will end up together jule be just another drug she s not entirely in love she might be addict",
          "very true for all we know rue ain t even into dick",
          "yh I definitely feel like something happen betwen they and that be why their start isolate themselves for each other I do not feel like the \" we grow apart \" be acurate",
          "yeah it look like they will take part of the episode show the consequence of rue s decision and then the rest of the episode show they be go to be okay since they met up in the promo for the next ep I think it be just hard because jule sem to be the only person after rehab that rue feel conect to and comfortable with and maybe that make she think she like jule as more than a friend or maybe she really do like jule as more than a friend",
          "I have two idea about jule she really do not love rue back because she do not like the idea of comitment since she be always mess with maried man or she really love rue but do not want rue to get hurt or hurt someone while jule be in this nate situation because she would have to admit to rue that nate be who she be really texte I think jule could be struggle with that but you never know",
          "I do not ship they but I think the theory be spot on jule fal so hard for tyler dep down she want to believe he be stil in there jule be such a naive character I think that be why it make sense to an extent",
          "rue sem really dismisive of lexi even during the few time when they ve be show hang out like at the carnival or roler rink she act as if she s not even there most of the time I do not think rue would act that way if they d have some prior relationship",
          "ya I get jealousy vibe to like maybe she have feeling for rue but she dosnt know how to expres they also after rue sister say that do lexi send rue a txt right away to see if she would answer or be she just try to not act interested in the conversation lexi character be play by maude aptow so I doubt she will be place as a background character",
          "now I be not say she should have be pick because I actually like the idea of rue s character be the main focus but even then it be not like her character can not stil be that and lexi stil get to narate everything but even then I be not say she should have replace she I remember think to myself as to why rue be the narator since in a lot of show and movie the narator be usualy a character that be very observant of those around they and introspect about other around they a lot sure rue be introvert but she be to concerned with her own life to be observant of other and I mean I do not blame she cuz she need to focus on get her shit together or even care about the life of her per that be not jule or posibly even lexi even though she pay my girl dust lol whenever rue be narate her own part though I like it and it make sense since she always sem like she be in her own little world I think lexi would be a good narator cuz it just sem that she be always take a backseat and observe everything that be happen outside of herself even in the very little interaction we have with she she sem that with each scene she be recognize the change and shift of those around her it would be col to see from the perspective of someone who discover with each step that the people she know about be go through dark time it would alsobe col to see a perspective from a teen who feel out of place with what her per be at now and what they be do and imagine how good the scene would be where she introduce we to rue it would be amazing",
          "I know they re suppose to be just friend but I can t help but see some real love in der",
          "I literally can not stop cry when rue go to jule house in tear because she do not want jule to get hurt like that shit resonate so much with I",
          "well he have sex with jule",
          "there be a lot of reason why it be obvious lexi be closet but do not want to confes her love for rue",
          "fuck out here misgendere jule twice in the same post",
          "I think you be right about the show direction concern rue and jule my heart will break to but I love the angst we don t know rue s sexuality yet but I m lean towards pan I do not know hopefuly they will let we know throughout the season",
          "I think we have already establish how all of the other character costume represent their personality but no one talk about lexi s bob ros as you all may know be the quite calm dude who provide a lot of comfort to the people who watch lol I be get emotional sorry he be genuinely a nice dude same can go for lexi who be the calm force of the show it also paint what role she have in this episode where she be busy try to help and provide comfort for her friend some example include be there for rue when she be at her low point and give her reasure word and her prevent mckay to see cassie bcus if they be to breakup it should be in a les chaotic situation anyways I love lexi you all I really do",
          "rue unknowingly use jule as a proxy high jule have be unfairly sadle with the responsibility of look out for rue what should someone in jule position do here should she issue an ultimatum and leave would it be somewhat her fault if rue relapse",
          "I hope we see more of that in s cuz right now I do not really like jule that much I mean I love her character but she be act real unusual",
          "I know I be super late but there be many thing that hint to she be in love or have feeling for rue they would not just add gia telling lexi she be in love with jule for no reason show do not do that and in the first or second episode I think maybe the third when they be do the cherleading pep rally thing in the cafeteria if you pay close attention everyone look at who they like nate look at mandy maddy look at nate kat at ethan I think rue at jule and lexi at rue then lexi kind of freak out when they kis I do not know it just sem like she be into rue and I do not think she be asexual but more like a les sexual person but stil enjoy it just very vanila",
          "like in a platonic way or in a romantic way though",

          "I have not already end season but I m completely into this ship I love they so much I think they should be together even if it could be to predictable and that s why I think this be not their choice",
          "sometimes you don t let someone in not because they don t love you or care for you but because you re in conflict with yourself and you think you don t deserve they or if you let they in they ll eventualy see the real you and run off now I don t know if this be the case with jule but that s one of the reason that come to my mind",
          "don t really think jule be lead she on at all to be honest at least not intentionaly pretty comon for girl bf to lay up with each other and say I love you we see rue do the same with her sister",
          "jule have no idea rue be go through a bad episode of depresion they both lie to each other and tell each other they have the flu it s not like jule know rue be go through a bad time and decide to ghost she anyways she s go through her own shit herself you know",

          "it s definitely a complicated situation that could be resolve if they talk to each other lol but you know how tenager be jule be hide the nate secret from rue and that s obviously afect her in tonight s episode rue s vo do say I don t know why jule didn t trust I so it sem to imply that rue will find out eventualy whether through jule or not we have yet to see xb I feel bad for rue because she s not even the one put all that presure on jule she s not the one say I m stay clean for you it s all these other people around they who be tell that to jule rue be just act normal she doesn t even sem to put presure on the romantic aspect of their relationship",
          "she s certainly figure out her sexuality to there s many hint that she harbor feeling for rue from the linger gaze she give jule and rue to the comment she give about not be interested in guy guy not be interested in her meme aside it s not just that she s shy I think she could posibly be a lesbian bisexual fluid and on top of that have a crush on rue edit remember that she practice french kising with rue in their youth",

          "while this be ofcourse a very good point we don t yet know if rue be also struggle with her sexuality in adition to her addiction or just in general not be able to form any meaningful relationship in the past perhaps partly due to her self estem we see an example in rue s think naration I m such a loser she could be just fal for her plain and simple I totally agree with you that it s not jule fault I could see their arc s either go with with jule realize that she s bi this would probably make a lot of shiper happy p or like you say it s part of rue s arc to overcome the issue s of be an addict which sem more likely",
          "he look at she when finish texte if so this next episode be go to be soo stresful my baby rue",
          "I feel like I m one of the only people who take the kising scene as imply that lexi isn t into girl as opose to rue who be she do make a strange expresion but the first thing out of her mouth be be this like really weird and uncomfortable for you which doesn t really feel like a that be well than I expect and now I m confused thing to say I think the scene betwen she and cassie in the late episode be hint towards she not be into guy but that also doesn t automaticaly mean she s into girl she might be ace irc kat mention asexuality to maddy so at the very least the writer know what it be I think it d be col if she be since I can t think of many positively portray asexual character on tv right now outside of bojack horseman and maybe shadowhunter",
          "like rue be literally have the bad depresive episode of her life and jule ghost she for a week strongly contribute to that while rue be semingly almost die from her depresion jule be hok up with some stranger she just met like I feel like that first experience should ve be for rue I wonder if rue will be jealous or sad or if jule will even tell she like what be jule even on in the club like I think she snort coke but then she be act like she be on moly while have intense lsd shromy visual I do not know anyways I can not wait for the season finale",

          "I like the analogy the only thing that I would say be that romeo and juliet come from family who be at war with each other and that s why they couldn t be together but rue and jule have no one opose their love they don t need to kep a secret from anyone",
          "honestly I hope they do not I see how it could happen and I can totally see rue get close to lexi for suport but I would be so disapointed with lexi if she fal for it she know what rue have be through and she must know that rue as a recover addict would not so much love she but more use she for suport and to not be alone I hope lexi be there for rue when she need she but I think they become romanticaly involve would be a little to much",

          "I think there be a reason ali her \" coach \" I can not think of the another word kind of warm rue about jule in general I think people who be just recover from addiction be always discourage from start new relationship because it can take they off their journey to stay clean look back that scene in episode I think where jule ride off on her bike leave rue by herself and the previous suny sky turn cloudy and begin to rain be foreshadow I always feel like it be but ali s word plus the preview for the next episode kind of confirm this where someone be question if jule even really like rue in the way that she want I be nervous that rue be codependent on jule and if jule do not reciprocate feeling or something happen to their relationship the literal cloud and rain will come back into rue s life we already see how quick rue be to turn back to drug the second jule be not around she for a couple hour",
          "her genuine afection for jule be a redeem quality",
          "well even though jule do the shiti move in the last ep we should stil take it under consideration she s the one who change rue a lot and she s be in a lot of shit herself lately to maybe it s just a phase I know she ll get her shit all back together in s",
          "I didn t see it as an eye rol lexi definitely have some thought about it but they aren t clear to the viewer yet there be a reason why the writer add this scene of rue s sister tell lexi about it and I do feel that there be more to it than she outgrow the group gues time will tell",
          "I love how think out this be I never really wonder about lexi before more just wonder how she get to be such a high name on the list of actor and actres on the show with little line but this make I really excited for her upcoming episode and conect to she in a way that I hadn t before",
          "I think they both know rue s act weird remember how cocky rue be when she say who shyguy",
          "yeah posibly they put a lot of emphasis on jule be a bit to much like her drug habit with ali that I can t see it end up the same as now they get together way to early in the show probably a part of rue s recovery arc be reconecte with her previous friend s before it go downhil",
          "I do not think it be a good reason but maybe she know that at the end of the day gia and her mom will stil love she no matter what because they be family whereas with jule she have that fear that she really could decide it be to much for she to handle and call it quit it be definitely not healthy I think they encourage newly recover addict to stay out of a relationship while get clean for that reason",
          "totally agree it be because a major resentment and I be not sure how long they be go to last for",
          "I feel like he have two plan all along first to come out and say he actually like jule because he probably actually do then if that be to fail which it kind of do because she lowkey reject he his back up plan be to threaten she and black mail she for send nude to he as a way to cover it up and make it sem like he never like she in the first place and that this be all really a trap he be scared to come out and a psycho",

          "wait wait wait what the fuck but rue be in her house for like hour while jule be in la with hanah they have never met the fuck",
          "actually that scene at the carnival where gia say she s think rue be in love with jule be kind of weird she say it so awkward and casualy like gia know lexi be into rue or that something happen in the past that s stil touchy for lexi",
          "I agree for sure it sem to be something of an unpopular opinion though get more popular with each episode but I be not really a fan of rue and jule together their relationship be very toxic while lexi have be nothing but an amazing friend to rue all series of course you could argue that the way rue have treat lexi in return all series would make a lexi rue relationship toxic to but as rue have stay clean she be realize how bad a friend she be be and have make every efort to make up for that to lexi also you may or may not have see about lexi s character that raise some really good point",
          "I be start to get a weary feeling about where jule storyline be head the show start with rue s od be a struggle drug addict etc jule be the one who help she out of her darknes but it sem they have switch role and jule be fal off the rail understandably so I wonder if something bad will happen to jule atempt suicide at the end of the season as a juxtaposition to how rue arc begin",

          "that scene be amazing it be like jule be on a vision quest or something",
          "I know that if they try a relationship in the state that they be now it would probably end up bad because jule and rue be both mentaly fuck up rue have addiction issue and jule have trusting and self love issue but at the same time I can not ignore the fact that the existence of one another into their life be the principal reason why they be hang on",
          "I think the show do a very good job of show the fact that these two be tenager and rue s fal fast not only because she be young but also because jule be her new drug it be very interesting it be go to end horibly and I presume on a clif hanger for season finale",
          "I know it be come but I be getting anoy with how casualy intimate jule be be like i domt blame rue at all cuz jule be throw out signalsimd she have a godamn searchlight random aside do anyone notice rue description of love during kat story something along the line of you d rather die than be apart and they re the only light on this planet so she be def latch on to jule as her new drug",
          "I feel like rue be really in love with jule that she block everyone out at the carnival she even leave her sister behind not just lexi",
          "that s true I do not see the evidence point towards rue and lexi having ever be in a relationship that would be surprising if it do turn out to be true",
          "aside for jule not really be the good person for rue I feel bad about how many people have tell she that they will not work out even though her mom show full suport that guy from the addict suport group and nate have tell she the same thing jule do not like you and will forget about you like they be both make it rue s fault for get so atached",
          "after watch the scene where jule be in the club with her friend I decide to look up the lyric to the song that be play sam levinson say that detail be important the lyric to the song could be alude to how jule feel about her relationship with rue as well as nate the last line of the song say \" do not let somebody else s problem become yours \" this could tie to rue s addiction and jule issue of nate blackmail her",
          "rue say dep sht when she be narate",
          "first I want to say so I be in love with jule I want to take her home with I and introduce she to my cat now it be a good thing that I be high when I watch this episode because the stres level be through the fucking rof jule baby stop fuck texte the represed violent sexualy confused jock and just get swet with rue I do not need the stres there say it",
          "idkw but this ep let I down a lil bit I do not get as many emotion as I be use to get with the previous episode I gues tonight s ep do not give we that much story anyway talk about jule and rue what do you guy think be jule in love with rue or not because I be kind of confuse by the thing jule be say when she be on the pol talk to rue in other point of view I do think lexi be in love with rue but I do not know what do you guy think",
          "though I agree with they not be in a romantic relationship I kind of disagre on the whole understand each other because they really do not jule be to busy catch up in her own world to really care about rue s addiction and disorder while rue be just an outsider look in on jule life she be infatuate yes and know thing about her but time and time again she mistake jule afection for love so friend maybe but soulmate I do not think so",

          "do she only realize it when she go back to jule house in the first episode and jule take off her clothe or do she already know it I be surprised in that scene because rue sem to already know that jule be tran I e have no reaction whatsoever and I be simply wonder if I mis something thank",
          "b I agree she play that part so well she be like the fun suportive friend who be just along for the ride to gas up her friend and she do it well",
          "okay jule be definitely leave town in tomorow s episode alge just post on ig a short preview video of episode and in one of the shot jule be wear the same outfit top from previous spot in the trailer where she be by the train and stand up in a car I be gues this after the halowen party and after she break up with rue she leave because she do not want to deal with the situation and go to party with some people but that do not work out because she look kind of concerned in the video",
          "my opinion on lexi be that she might be a loner we haven t see much of she on the show so she might have other friend but we really don t know she sem empathetic with rue but she gets overshadow in this episode when jule come up and talk with rue and she find an escape out the situation",
          "exactly same thing I be tell my friend I really think something big be go to happen but we just get a chil and subtle finale",
          "do you mean jule or rue if you mean rue I be ify on she for a few reason until this episode I think her true color really show perhaps because it sem she be sober and man she be now a bad ass exactly as you mention",
          "ok so rue say she would never tell anyone that jule slep with cal yet she tell all of we do that mean that she hate she now or that jule die and that be why take it to the grave be say",
          "I love jule but she watch rue cry sob because she could not go and she do not stay for her instead she leave for ana you do not see how that be toxic to call someone your good friend and say you be in love with they and you leave at one of the low point in their life I stil ship they but that be mad toxic",
          "even with her minimal scene I be lean towards the idea that lexi have a thing be in love with rue she be always be suportive of rue and never turn she down pe in a cup for her episode when gia tell lexi that rue might be in love with jule lexi give off a surprised then nonchalant look whilst stil stare at the pair when gia leave she alone with they I would like to believe that there be a reason why that tiny scene be leave in the episode lexi sem to be the \" loner \" character who happen to like her good friend if it do not work out with jule maybe lexi will be there for rue",
          "that be rue realize she like kis girl",
          "I think you be spot on about jule and rue be more about jule be vulnerable and know rue be into her I think jule love she as a person and a friend but I would be shock if they end up have a real sexual romantic relationship I think this will crush rue in the proces and leave we hang for next season",
          "be real rue and jule have a toxic relationship the people eat it up though for whatever reason",
          "I haven t see any indication that rue s relationship with jule be sexual she have describe she several time as her new good friend",
          "yes thank you for the positivity I need it lol I never think about jule just be sad because she be high again my mind automaticaly go to she be dead probably just because of all the theory",
          "she s definitely a main character but I can t quite figure out what her role be why be she hang out with gia not really rue at the start of the episode if anything she react awkwardly and start texte to gia tell she that rue be in love with jule I think lexi stand out to much to be suport cast and they establish she have know rue for her entire life what s the end goal here of her arc",
          "you could not have say it well rue could not be more happy to admit it to her mom because she be be so stresed about this before and be just glad that she can be happy now I actually would understand how jule can be kind of awkward about this since she be never be in a relationship everyone be pretty awkward when they do something new I would like to think also I just look at this subredit this post actually have some good point I enjoy read other post about the previous episode to the old one might be debunk judge that they be make before this episode and probably other to but its nice to look at what could have happen and what do",
          "I co sign this I don t see it end well either which be make I really really woried for rue",
          "lol I be gay myself how be I look at it from a \" heteronormative \" way that be pretty dense to say nobody be say she be not atract to rue or woman for that matter bcus of \" her history \" they genuinely just do not see sign of jule have atraction for rue mention I anything that show jule like rue besides the kis in episode or be it four I do not know",
          "fair point she probably be like shit do I even know rue anymore kind of another reminder that they aren t close anymore por girl just mis her friend",
          "the theory be as folow euphoria be similar to romeo and juliet in many way first of all rue be short for romeo and jule be short for juliet second of all jule wear what juliet wear in the leonardo dicaprio version when juliet and romeo met for the first time in the halowen party scene third of all the forbiden off time love story betwen rue and jule top the cake this can give the audience some sort of foreshadow to how the show be go to end thought",
          "see but the thing about rule be why start the relationship to end it after two episode and after last episode I think jule be in a place that she want to explore that relationship beyond friend and to many of the cast ship they for they to end right now but eventualy they will end and same I be woried madi gets kill or at least shot at the end fez situation be a lot they have like pil botle so I wonder what happen but he be definitely out and about in the last episode",
          "I always run thing through that test aka how it would be perceive if it be a cishet relationship and while it s true I m personally more than fine with whichever outcome it s a max chloe situation they work amazingly well both as good friend and as girlfriend",
          "but be not that before she kis rue again I to believe jule be not in love with she but stil",
          "I be so sad for rue as much as I feel frustrated with jule and their relationship I stil do not want it to end like this for they as a bystander it be so frustrating for I to watch scene where rue be obviously hurt or bother by jule behavior and yet she do not want to say anything to jule because of how high on a pedestal she have she on",
          "I really disagre that jule loves rue the same way I just do not see it it sem like she want to acept the love rue hand out bcus she want to be in a healthy love relationship so why not be in a healthy relationship with someone who have treat you well than any guy you have ever know and especially since they have romantic feeling for you already",
          "I honestly just see lexi as an ace person like it would be really col to see that sexuality be portray because it s not that comon like as a demisexual person I really get vibe from lexi that she normaly do not get sexualy atract that often by other people but also she can just be shy I go through that to anyways can not wait to see her development in next season",
          "jule just have a strange encounter with a maried man and cut herself and rue be high as fuck if they be not a lil weird I would be surprised to be honest but sometimes it be just a matter of what part of the episode be write first",
          "ya especially after lexi tell she she s the reason rue be clean",
          "also when she say to that girl that she remind she of rue my first reaction be why because she s black I don t see what else they have in comon",
          "I think it would be awesome if lexi have feeling for rue",
          "I feel like rue like lexi but lexi do not like rue at the time and then thing get awkward betwen they and they start to isolate themselves from each other but I feel like lexi be now start to have feeling for rue but it be to late because rue be in love with jule or rue like lexi and lexi like rue but do not want to say anything but now she regreting not tell rue about her feeling or they be in a relationship and now lexi want rue bck and I also feel like when jule ask rue if she be every be in love I feel like lexi be rue first love",
          "I don t think it s that they ve forget it s just that rue hasn t really be clean long enough for all of it to come into focus she s stil act like an addict above all else except now her addiction be jule",
          "rue and jule be make out this will end up so badly I be scared",
          "yep date jule can t be gay gay man don t date jule gay man have exactly zero interest in jule who be the kind of man who would hit on jule dude who be into woman doesn t sound very gay to I",
          "I mostly agree with you I think their sexual relationship be pretty boring because I do not see it go anywhere I do not think jule be into woman I think rue be have a realization that she be likely bi or lesbian especially give her background of sem completely disintereste in the guy she hok up with so I apreciate that aspect of their relationship but that will only be explore once she do not have jule as her focus addiction I think jule feel bad for sort of lead rue on but she be vulnerable after the whole tyler thing and do not want to push away someone to actually love she so once again interesting but more because of what it say about jule than the actual relationship betwen they I hope to god they will stil be friend when thing end but I also see the ending lead to a relapse for rue",
          "I be really confused when she look at rue with jule in the clasrom after nate have be arest be she just jealous of their friendship or rue and jule as a couple I do not know if it be just I and I be be stupid I would gladly have someone explain if she be figure out her sexuality as well",
          "I ve think be about her relationship with jule for example when jule tell she about live in new york first sem like an anectdotic thing and later rue put herself in the fantasy she tell ali that they talk about live together jule tell she that she be act weird and she said its not true and the she be not jealous about tyler",
          "yup I plan on watch the two episode over again and I will definitely be look for this just wait for she to say \" this be the day you will always remember as the day you almost catch rue benet \"",

          "I be like in agrement with you I do comment last week that I get a vibe from lexi that she maybe love rue more than just \" childhod good friend \" but this episode kind of make I lean toward she just really mis the dynamic she rue have the way she give jule credit for rue s hapines when they be at the roler rink do not sem like a girl who be consciously in love with her good friend and understandably jealous of the girl who be the true object of rue s afection I be open to the posibility that the writer stil have not show we a lexi point of view episode yet at this point omniscient narator rue probably would have say something if lexi have actual romantic feeling for her but maybe that be a slow burn character narative personally I would love to see maude apatow be give something a little juicer to sink her act chop into that just the third whel replace good friend",
          "I think that be the route that they re go to go with when gia say rue love jule lexi have a look on her face",
          "I do not see how they can be together jule be tran female and sem to be sexualy atract to man",
          "for I I start interpret rue being into she as more than a friend with the whole bike scene and jule joke \" you be talk to your mama about I \" like jule try to play it off and make it lighthearte because she be amazing and I love she but to I rue be def hurt a bit by it in part it feel like rue be hurt that jule do have such a positive relationship with her dad but it feel like there be an element of be call out by jule that be not intend but rue s true feeling be betray a bit even if she be not really aware of they",
          "I agree with everything you ve say folk who don t believe that jule return rue s atraction be not pay attention even hunter have make clear in interview that what rue and jule feel be real even if it isn t healthy in its curent state",
          "she s and she only really start flake after she realize how much rue depend on her I don t really blame jule but that doesn t change the fact that she s really bad for rue",

          "I totally understand why rue do what she do with jule near the end of episode yes they be good friend and jule be into shyguy but she be also pretty intimate with rue they slep together spon say \" I love you \" and do that intimate forehead touch I also understand people can be super close and just be friend but when someone do thing like this do they really not have any feeling towards the other person I really like jule as a character but I also really feel for rue and it sem like jule be lead she on a bit especially when she know rue be jealous which would sugest she could tell how rue really feel be anyone else feel this way",
          "I do think she genuinely have this infatuation crush on jule but it be go to get all fuck up because rue have an adictive personality and I do not see jule take be rue s crutch very well its entirely to much presure to be someone be landline esp since they could spiral if you make a wrong move I do think it be an actual romantic sexual atraction because if they want rue to be the clingy toxic bestie they would not write their interaction as so romanticaly code esp on rue s side no gal pal here",
          "those be my thought exactly nothing in this show have give I the impresion that jule be into woman so I don t understand the ship",
          "yes it do feel to I like she take advantage of jule ' vulnerability but jule also use she as \" pacifi \" for sad sex so they kind of use each other it may feel like the girl from the nightclub benefit more but that girl be def just a tol for jule",
          "nah I want lexi to be with a girl",
          "so during the jule flashback rue mention that jule imagine spend her life with her good friend and live together in new york I can not remember the exact word and I plan to rewatch and update this post but aparently rue mention that jule tell that to rue be that corect be that imply that jule tell rue she like she I be super confused by that part",
          "fair enough my whole thing with rue and jule relationship and I mean that in the sense of what we ve see thus far up to the end of episode be that it sem build on an intense level of intimacy not necesarily sexual rue share her story of addiction and jule share her sexual discovery and a level of imense trust exist betwen the two now whether rue have be atract to jule from the begining we stil do not know if rue identifie as a lesbian pan or quer maybe there s a more apropriate term so please let I know if that s the case or it s a byproduct of her addiction or just be a curious kid I do not know what I do know be that scene in episode where rue apologize to jule be one of the most intimate exchange I ve ever see be it on tv or real life when jule embrace rue and their face to face literally hang on each other s next breath how the fuck be rue suppose to interpret that situation other than how she do then we come to episode where we get more of jule history where her bud sexual identity sem as rue say to be cis white straight man jule say she doesn t top which make sense to I so her sexual orientation as I see it be as a straight female which again I totally get but then after the falout with nate she go to rue as a both a friend and as a place of comfort hunter schaefer the actres who play jule have say in interview that the two view each other as their respective home which be absolutely lovely to I but then we see that beautiful montage of they get to know one another and how comfortable they be in each other s presence and jule go for that kis be it a moment of pasion a suden realization of sexual fluidity I do not know if that s the right term or be it just hey I like you and this feel right at this moment and that s all it have to be so where do they go from here I feel like if they decide to pursue a romantic relationship then eventualy sex would be involve and that could mean anything to anyone but I feel like in this particular pair there be certain logistic that need to be discus again this be a hypothetical scenario about fictional character on a television show so I apologize for get way to into it but couple like this exist so that s why it pop into my head about the potential for such a moment to discus",
          "maybe good theory honestly most of the character have a solid reason to comit suicide if they want to lexi sem to be the most level head stable focus and drama free character she sem like the type to kep her head down folow the rule get good grade and be sucesful in colege unlike the other who be be traumatize kind of over and over but we will see lol",
          "man can you imagine if they pul a modern romeo and juliet like rue think jule run away and know nate be the reason I hate say this as well but in this scenario I see lexi as mercutio the friend that die and set romeo off nate will mess up somehow and fataly harm lexi which will triger an already spiral rue into go after he rue kill nate like romeo kill tybalt then she od s because without jule she do fentanyl again that shit be dangerous jule learn that rue have die and that she kill nate so the guilt she feel overwhelm she to the point that she kill herself just a theory but I see it line up so well",
          "rue be definitely into jule but do rue \" know \" I kind of get the impresion stil watch e that she do but the I also get the impresion that she have no idea",
          "but if that be after the halowen party I gues the breakup must take place in the midle of the episode somehow and a few day later jule leave she obviously come back because the dance be either episode or and we all know she go with rue so maybe they will reconcile somewhere in episode and decide to go to the dance together after her short leave",
          "and that confusion and insecurity be on both side rue even question why jule be use a gay date app and jule doesn t really answer so even though jule apear so fully confident in be a girl she obviously stil harbor insecurity or concern regard the type of people who would be interested in she because she s pre non op I m honestly really apreciate the subtlety this show be bring into the development of these character because I think it s so eye opening for many of we who don t think of the day to day of other in a different situation than our own",
          "I know a lot have be say about comparison betwen romeo and juliet r j initial the costume recital of line rue as a male figure for halowen and euphoria but I do not think enough focus have be place on hamlet s paralel unlike romeo and juliet hamlet have be directly reference during the show with the painting of the death of ophelia by be john everet milais depict ophelia drown clutch flower now to make some reach when I think of the flower one character stand out jule from the first scene jule be asociate with flower wear a shirt with they embroider on she have also wear flowery eye make up in a few ocasion hamlet also focus on mental ilnes and mental degradation and as see with last episode and yes I know this be drug induce jule be not do all that well ophelia s insanity be garner through be subject to both physical and emotional manipulation throughout the play from those around her when jule be lay in bed with the \" revolving dor \" of the people from her past she be also in a way lose her grasp on reality after the manipulation she have experience as well as the romantic dysphoria betwen she and rue I can not fully guarante that jule will sufer a similar fate to juliet or ophelia but I can expect at least a subversion of their story posibly she almost do but in the end she do not I would love to hear your thought on this and anything you can add",
          "I want she to have romantic feeling for rue so bad to be honest I ship rue and jule but I kind of ship rue and lexi to and I want another lgbt character on the show",
          "as we see in episode and rue be like really protective of her sister and she even threaten to potentialy torture troy if he get gia high again and when that be happen I be like cher on rue in the background she be also really protective of jule which I have mixed feeling about I want she to let go of jule but at the same time it make I happy to see rue change as a person she just do not want gia or anyone she care about to be miserable and end in a place that she be in",
          "I actually do not realize jule be tran til this episode I feel dumb but totally agree there be a lot of good moment in this episode",

          "same that be so cute to bad it do not work out lol",
          "I feel like they be use lexi and rue as the comedy relief duo on the show and it s really refreshing because this show have I tense as hell most of the time I really like see they together that way just think I d share that",
          "you have never make a weirdly quick friendship at a party multiple time I will end up in a stranger home eat mac n chese at am or something this be not that weird",
          "I do not know if this be mention already but lexi have a lgbt pride flag hang in her room",
          "at one point I think lexie do like rue but I just think she be kind of jealous because she know rue have replace she with someone else I be not go to rule out her be in love with rue but I think it be more reasonable to say she be jealous until we see her backstory mix with cassie",
          "please dear lord do not fck thing up betwen jule and rue they be ready for this relationship pls give they a try",
          "I feel like they be conect to each other and they might even be soulmate but that do not mean that a romantic relationship be in the card for they it just mean they understand each other in way no one else do",
          "I think rue stil feel like she need to protect gia and lexi will be a good safety net she might relapse but this episode prove it isn t definite",
          "I feel like she realize she have feeling for rue not that she be necesarily atract to woman in general in her drug haze she think she s hok up with a man and before she have comment that the woman remind she of rue",
          "it just feel like they re mistake friendship for love and that rue be more invest in jule than jule be it s pretty obvious jule be not only straight but more into nate tyler but that guy be so mess up that she probably need rue to know how it s like to be in a relationship where she isn t treat as a sex object but at the same time rue s clingines to jule be not healthy you can t build a relationship on dependency and there s no way jule be go to quit man to be with rue that s not something that be go to happen",
          "yep I definitely a rue like a friend and know didn t stand a chance but to emotional and become my new issue when I already have issue end up hang on feeling for year binge watch episode to and I decide to confes last week we haven t speak again until now gues nothing in highschol last forever",
          "jule be go to distance herself from rue out of fear of be the reason behind her sobriety she be start to do hang with reckles people to cop with she be stres out she go to a party I asume with some new people in one of the trailer and stand in a car go through a tunel in another which I asume be in the same episode probably I do not think that be go to end well and she come back to town hurt in some way and run back to rue",
          "to I that look be lexi realize she s be replace as rue s good friend like you say lexi be a loner she doesn t have any friend look back at all her scene I think lexi will comit suicide I post why",
          "this be what I think to before see another theory that they would not end up together this be before episode I gues I want to be really open with the idea just in case I would love for they to stay together I gues the fact that jule be not really open with her dad it be ok not to share every personal detail about their relationship but it sem like she might be ashamed and the guy from rehab talk about how it would not last get to I it would actually be genius if the show put all this potential foreshadowing but it actually work out in the end by the way go look at the other theory if you have not already I actually think they have really good point about they stay together",
          "I think jule be huflepuf",
          "not the only one to I that scene be suppose to show we rue realize she be into girl after all the montage be about her sexual history the focus be only on her reaction to the kis I m with you on the asexuality theory she hasn t show interested in anyone her mother mock she because her halowen costume isn t sexy enough she find the kis with rue very uncomfortable she didn t think rue could be into jule posibly because that doesn t even cros her mind people think that she stare at jule and rue together be a sign of jealously but to I she be just feeling replace because they be good friend before jule come along I notice they stop make her stare at they now that rue be her friend again there be no longing look anymore and I think that tense moment in the halowen episode when lexi call jule out be the perfect moment to add some jealously plot but the writer never go there so I do not know definitely lean more torward asexual than secret lesbian crush",
          "yeah probably just friend s jealousy but this stuff be unpredictable see the promo and all those sad note of the future episode gues how rue be about to heal her broken heart l e x i or o x y",
          "yeah and episode the minute spech scene lexi stand for rue like a lot how rue treat she be terible",
          "in the end when she kis peter I be like it be like jule and rue",
          "I think rue will get high and kill jule I know it be far fetched but wow that would be something",
          "I mean sure a romantic feeling could be a posibility but as of now I just think it s a strained friendship it sem like rue use lexi when it benifit she",
          "I never say they would end disastrously they can both just acknowledge that rue s health should be prioritize and part way",
          "the way she smile when rue texte her melt the world",
          "I need to rewatch but didn t the kis scene imply that rue feel something and lexi didn t she look kind of bored while rue be like oh this make sense to I xb I think they become close again when thing go bad with jule but probably nothing more than friendship",
          "not much you can do all you can do be see that it be not you be fault she should not be force to take care of someone you can see jule be not ready for something like that but rue become to atach",
          "rue fal head over hel in love with jule from the moment she met she let we not pretend that jule be the only impulsive one when it come to claim love",
          "man I really be not a big fan of jule right now and it be this final episode that do it I be frustrate by her fake woke personality it be imature and she really do not take rue s feeling into acount this episode like make a decision and stop play with her she be a fucking addict for christ sake",
          "I don t think jule have any bad intention when she say she want to live with rue but she s definitely not help by not tell she she doesn t have romantic feeling for her and whatvalinsaid be very true sometimes nothing in highschol last forever",
          "imagine if lexi be the narator I be glad she be not but we would literally know everything she be friend with rue cassie madie kat etc rue even say I think it be about the dick pic on nate s phone lexi tell she about they which also side note rue say she and lexi be not even really friend but lexi must try to talk to she because she tell she these thing which make I kind of sad for my girl lexi lexi literally know everything and she do not even care she be just wait for rue to be her friend again",
          "she could be both jealous and suportive I always think that jealousy in film and tv be a bit exagerated and that most people wouldn t act like that in real life at this point it isn t clear if lexi be truly into rue but I do feel like it s head that way why else would they have rue s sister tell lexi that rue be in love or show the flashback scene of rue teach she to french kis that say they do have lexi say that the kis feel uncomfortable and awkward which could mean that kis girl just isn t something that get she go unles she say it to cover up the fact that she do feel something and that she didn t want to make thing awkward herself gues we ll find out soon enough",
          "I be talk about the last episode by the way and the one before that jule know what she be do",
          "yeah I agree wirth you without jule I do not know what the show could become they have awesome moment share",
          "do you mean jule he definitely know he be texte she because she send he those nude rue tok and her face be in those",
          "I think she be the child hod friend you have out grow",
          "I think lexi probably have feeling for she and would be open to be use more but I m really hope rue in a good enough place by the end that it s a non issue",
          "I think the quer relationship she be enjoy be with rue I do not see lexi and jule at all",
          "rue initiate the first kis not jule when she do its after getting blackmail by nate I take that as she look for comfort and then we have this episode be jule kep tell her dad that she and rue aren t a thing",
          "I have only see a few people talk about this I would like to know what you guy think personally I think in the th episode that jule be find out she be either straight or just not into rue which I feel upset about but I hope rue have a good recovery when it happen there be be a lot of foreshadow it would be strange if it do not happen at this point",
          "I hope jule and rue end up together I love their chemistry and they be so cute",
          "jule be suppose to ask rue if she s ever be in love next episode I imagine rue look back on her previous experience and we get that scene",
          "I do not know dude the way rue be act re jule all episode be build to that the question be whether it s legitimate love or she s just latch onto jule in response to the lack of drug",
          "ya like I say not everyone feel that way but as far as tie and jule I couldn t agree more sadly I don t think it be go to last like reu want it to",
          "they ve be glue to each other s hip since episode rue hasn t change around she since the kis jule do xb not sure why you re get the impresion that rue be force a romantic relationship on her she be even ready to forget about the whole thing in episode if you mean ask to slep at her house again that s just the way they ve be act since they met like how many time have these two share a bed by now rue be probably just use to do it at this point",
          "lol you all hate and you all mad because rue want jule and not lexi",
          "you talk shit on lexi of course you re go to get downvote i d call that a radical interpretation of the text do you consider yourself a shity person ya know since you re not a saint I hope not but by your own logic you should so all op mean be lexi s just another one of those good old average every day american siner who sometimes prioritize the need of other above do what s moraly right she s just like we so sem like maybe you need to think before you speak and beforefo you downvote",
          "I just don t think that lexi be into rue romanticaly could be wrong but they just sem like friend who have grow apart and lexi be saden by that",
          "agree I do not think lexi be actually texte but rather just try to look ocupy as she be leave alone after rue kind of forgot about her I just think that towards the end of the season when shit hit the fan lexi will be the one rue might be able to lean on and posibly have a relationship with who know with this show",
          "I be not a big fan of jule now with the way she be act around rue I feel like she be not go to tell rue how she feel and just kep lead she on and give her hope now and then rue deserve a win man cmon",
          "that be what I be think we do not know enough about rue to know if these feeling be genuine but if they be jule be unintentionaly lead she on a little I do not think a lot of people would act like jule if they know their friend be into they but would act like that if they think there be no way they like they and it be just platonic afection",
          "I wonder to like would jule enjoy the conventional way",
          "first of all sorry if someone have already talk about this but I ve be look to all the promos like the show s promo in order to find any frame we haven t see yet and here s what I ve notice this have to be these be I think they kep pretend they aren t together run while cry",
          "I definitely think rue be into the kis it feel like rue have the epiphany that she like kis girl while lexi wasn t really into it",
          "I m rot for the oposite because rue need friend like lexi and fez no need to make it complicate by put they in a relationship",
          "same here I don t want anything to happen to jule that beautiful soul be cause my anxiety to go up",
          "okay it might just be I but the entire not real interaction betwen nate and jule get I feel some type of way like I know he be chaotic energy but also I just want jule to finally find someone that will love she for who she be that \" most beautiful girl \" like have I tear up lowkey also I be def shiping rue and jule at the same time and hopefuly these bitch can get the freak on and love each other lt",
          "it s a theory but I doubt it the director of this show just release a feature film with the actres that play lexi in he know she personally so I don t see he kill she off just to send a message about suicide her role in the show admitedly have be limit but frankly so be her act chop I haven t really be blow away by anything she have say or do in the show",
          "what she say I think that rue just feel for who she be portray or show it just hit she that jule really do that to she and maybe she be not someone she think she fal inlove with rue be stil learn",
          "I personally feel she be majorly fuck up over the nate situation and that she do care for rue romanticaly but she also feel it be all go to fast someone post about the romeo and juliet line that jule say to rue and they kind of explain it so basically by use this line jule be state that it be all happen to fast that their \" love \" be to much for her if that make sense or I could be over analyze and she be just say shit because she be drunk",
          "that could be interpret as she be sad that her good friend isn t go to spend as much time with her it s pretty comon",
          "I be not say that they be go to end in bad term I think they be not go to end together this season or maybe they will",
          "I have the theory that unfortunately thing betwen rue and jule will not work out because exist a large probability that nate end up fal in love with jule and vice versa I definitely could see a romantic relationship grow up betwen rue and lexi because that scene leave I wonder to I be even go to write a post about it this morning but I be to slepy to remember lexi name ahah",
          "oh and rue teaching lexi how to kis be a reach girl do that shit all time doesn t mean there in love",
          "rue say they weren t friend when she be really mad at she for interupt she get high rue s be try to make it up to she since",
          "to be honest lexi s be a little more of a general statement it may not be in the finale but I wouldn t be surprised at all if she eventualy end up come out and to be honest so many crazy thing have hapened already lead up to the finale so you know that for the finale they re go to go out with a bang",
          "lexi be a non entity",
          "now I be read a few review about the show when I come a cros this one it s a very detailed review about the first episode it get everything right so far and it also confirm some stuff about rue and jule don t read it if you don t want the first episode spoil here s the link",
          "you catjameson be morgan fucking freman and this the beging of the third act",
          "I see it more as a family like bond then romantic they have love but it be very platonic",
          "I know people really like the idea of they together but I just don t see it I think lexi probably mis rue s friendship more than anything it doesn t sem like she really have anyone else",
          "this episode be uncomfortable as hell I asume jule be fuck up over the be dependent on her and I think that s what rue believe to but base on nate s blackmail at the end I kind of think she be freak out over that maybe this be wishful thinking because I think they re cute as hell together as friend or girlfriend but I think jule feel trap by nate be efect her relationship with rue I know a lot of people say she s straight but I do not know I think it would be really easy to go in that direction but the show have be pretty subversive which be why I think we ll find out her true feeling once rue figure out what nate have do thought",
          "I haven t see indication of that I ve see a very close potentialy unhealthy bond betwen two girl not sexual though",
          "the character who have cheat really just cassie I don t consider rue and jule as together be show to be under intense emotional stres for what they have do and the secret they be kep because they know how damaging it will be to the other person definitely not take it lightly",
          "you can also see roler skate next to lexi s bed for example in episode at",
          "she do I feel like I rue when she think about jule I a healthy way I just love her mostly because I ve be have conversation about be a great person and I can t even say I know more than or people that just good people but I feel like she would be great person if we met",
          "she s just act like normal friend would i don t see where you all be get this idea that she s in love with rue",
          "of yeah this sub ride for hunter jule heavy I include figure op be cancel after hrs",
          "I hope jule win t break rue s heart bco they be amazing together",
          "jule will break it off she be not one to setle and be scared rue will probably relapse and pis jule off then they will be friend again sometimes it be healthy to be friend then be in a relationship",
          "nah rue s super brief and horifying sexual history make it sem like she s never genuinely be into dude they ve get that we re broken people from shity circumstance so friend become family bond",
          "it s pretty spell out that nate be abusive and both maddy and nate be toxic it s also pretty spell out that jule be nowhere near as interested in rue as rue be in jule I don t think jule consider herself a lesbian or bi but rather got catch up in rue s obsesion with she and be upset that she have to hurt a person she genuinely care about",
          "I don t think lexi be in love with rue but she be just sad that she doesn t have a friend to hang out with anymore I do agree that lexi be a loner though",
          "kising be most of the time sexual and the next episode after that kis reu be already pretty much say they be date and she be stil kind of of not sure at the same time for all we know jule may not even think they be date and that be only in reu s head she be the narator of the show",
          "I asume they be both equaly high I do not know also I think jule somewhat use the hokup to see if she be into girl in general and not just make an exception for rue",
          "I understand why so many viewer love lexi and for the record I think she be a breath of fresh air amongst the character however I gues I see she as an enabler and while I think she mean well have a good heart she constantly let we rue walk all over her I feel that lexi be extremely insecure and instead of stand up for herself and set boundary she let we rue and her drug addiction dictate their friendship lexi really should not be give rue clean urine if she want she to clean up and get sober while I adore lexi for other reason I gues I view her friendship with rue diferently I do not think rue deserve to have lexi as a friend and I wish lexi would stand up for herself their friendship be unhealthy and rue take advantage of her I be wonder if anyone else feel this way",
          "yeah I agree it do not sem intentional because she really sem to want to be rue s good friend I just feel like the whole tasteful nude situation know rue be jealous be not the good decision but maybe jule be just oblivious which be super comon when one friend like another but have not explicitly say anything",
          "to I she loked weirde out but that s just I but I think like any teen drama people be go ship happy sometimes thing take at face value be what s what but who know what s go to happen betwen they",
          "I think this be spot on I be a little late but come back after x I think jule truly realize her feeling for rue",
          "right you could tell the girl ana be into jule the moment she walk into the room and probably figure she would try to hok up with jule later on",
          "no he just see rue as a young sister we don t know enough to say he s asexual if anybody be it s probably lexi",
          "I don t think she s jealous I think she s grow up and doesn t want to deal with their drama and I stil think she s upset with how rue treat she last time they be together",
          "after tonight I get to say it be really hard to diferentiate I be lean toward she actually have a crush on jule",

          "could you please clarify I m not sure how ask about a particular detail of the show mean that I mis the point by which I asume you mean that rue see jule as a person first and foremost not simply as a trans person",
          "good rule scene so far in my opinion rue s soft tone of voice and jule clasp her finger onto rue s jacket there be something really special there playful intimate kind of reasure because it confirm to I that jule definitely feel something more than friendship for rue which I be not sure of before anyone who say she do not be blind lie to themselves",
          "I mean she s show interest in jule",
          "gia care about rue want to help she amp see if she s alright and all she get in return be I be go to need you to leave I the fuck alone alright smh maybe I take that to heart because I ve try to help people I care about and they hit I with that sometimes I get biter amp hold long grudge to where I don t give af what happen to they anymore rue should be so lucky",
          "I kind of get vibe that she be jealous when gia say rue s in love with jule last episode",
          "just start watch but have watch later episode with my mom I watch episode five with her at the end it sem like jule do not like rue back do jule just have a lot of presure on she since she be the reason rue have not do drug for day",

          "I mean last episode have rue get all bashful when jule be tease her then rue be wiling to go sober for jule rue light up when jule be around and get jealous over \" tyler \" she be clearly uncomfortable take the picture of jule they have be drop mad hint that rue be in love with jule maybe I have just share enough similar experience that I recognize it for example when I be in colege and stil in the closet my friend who I have a thing for ask I to help she put on a costume that require I to aply plastic wrap and duct tape to her naked body like I be so uncomfortable because I be like \" holy shit she be naked and right in my face \" but stil try to be col and hide the fact that I be super turn on by she",
          "I have the chesy grin on my face by the end of the episode my gay little heart have be want to see they together from the begining to they be just so cute together not to mention how beautiful they both be I do not think it will end well unfortunately but I hope at least they both learn something and grow from it",
          "there be definitely a convincing amount of evidence to believe that lexi do have feeling for rue her behavior throughout the show towards rue rue never stop to consider how something might afect lexi s feeling but despite that lexi always consider rue s the favor she do for her the look on lexi s face at the carnival when gia say she think rue be in love with jule the bit in rue s sexual history flashback where she talk about teaching lexi how to french kis where rue sem unbothered yet lexi say it be weird and uncomfortable for her etc there be article and whatnot on the internet that describe it probably well than I do but tldr yeah I think lexi do have a crush on rue",
          "yeah well now that rue have realize that she be a bad friend towards lexi maybe their relationship will develop",
          "I feel like lexi will kill herself since no one notice she probably not though since she s jud apatow s daughter and nepotism be alive and well in showbiz",

          "ikr he do have sex with jule but she tell he that she be",
          "I think so to but rue and jule do not even know each other and it look like rue be kind of impresed turn on from jule reaction so I be stil on the board that that line refer to something that happen in e or beyond",

          "yeah I know what you mean I think jule not be open with her dad could be that she be never be in a relationship before so this be definitely new to she and she be stil figure it out where as rue be all open and about it lol as for ali s conversation with rue he be right rue have to get clean for herself not for someone else and the soon she realize that the well her relationship will be in a way it be not fair the presure she be put on jule here be to hope that gets clear up soon where do you read up on theory high key interested in read they as well",
          "the first episode in episode gia make a comment about rue being in love with jule and lexi be clearly disatisfied and then they hit we in episode with rue and lexi kising and lexi look sort of confused and panic episode don t give that same vibe show they more as friend it just doesn t feel resolve yet",
          "that be the scary thing since jule be the only one rue conect with since rehab she be go to go down such a spiral if thing fal apart haha I need it to be sunday already",
          "rue to I sem unphased lexi be the awkward one it sem like rue come there to do what she say she be go to do which be teach lexi how to french kis by the way wtf french kising be where you stick your tongue in the other person mouth xb she be take aback because it sem as though lexi be not as clueles about make out as she might have think which I think be because lexi be really into it xb lexi be the one lean in draw out the kis xb lexi ask if it be uncomfortable because she herself enjoy it but might have be question her sexuality during this time and be feel at that moment overwhelm and confused rue though I don t think that be a look of enjoyment on her face more like hm I think you didn t know how to french kis xb also in this trailer at around second the naration say something about be lostand lexi be show on the scren lose like confused about her sexuality be a loner in general and not really fiting in or have anyone to confide to xb I think part of lexi s subplot will be about she come to term with her sexuality there ll be a moment where rue find out but I don t see that be anything major just like when rue and jule make up at the carnival but not as complex lexi probably do at some point have a crush on rue but I think that pas over fairly quickly and go into just how much she mis have rue as a friend I also think there friendship will repair itself later on with lexi be more present in the series and she be more at ease with be gay xb there s only two more episode after episode and lexi doesn t have her own episode so there can not be to much go on xb tldr lexi be a lesbian she probably have a brief crush on rue but that s not a major story line",
          "I think lexi be hela jealous of rue and jule and we be go to see the falout this after jule break rue heart later on in the season",
          "I see a whole lot of people ship rue amp jule but I honestly wish they just stay friend it be become so aparent in the recent episode that jule be start to feel traped overwhelmed that she be feel like rue have swap drug for their relationship and be become addict to her like when lexi say that rue be well be because of jule and she get overwhelmed and go to the bathrom at the skating rink but of course to protect rue from relapse she be go to be to scared to break it off with she because then if rue relapse she will feel like it be her fault jule be obviously way more atracted to guy than girl and only kis rue that night after met tyler because her head be all over the place and it be in the heat of the moment and now rue got heavily atach to she",
          "yeah I know what their relationship be curently but I do not see how that stop they from be romanticaly involve",
          "rue be into her unlike the other young woman portray in the show rue s sexual history be leave blank it be go to be center on jule and jule like guy",
          "be I the only one that do not ship they I feel rue be at that point where she be well off alone and just have friend there to suport her rue need to learn to love herself before anyone else",
          "call I an optimist but I think they be endgame maybe not this season but perhaps in the next or series finale some of hunter interview I have see read have somewhat hint at it as well along with the overwhelming suport the ship have do not get I wrong they will have to work through a lot like rue codependency on she with sobriety and jule issue with nate cal but I think there be genuine love betwen the two",
          "I m so happy to see your prediction I ve be think that since the carnival episode when she imediately turn to her phone after gia mention rue being in love with jule I m new to this sub and haven t see any post discus that moment though I m sure there probably be some I agree with the rest to especially and",
          "wow you guy make way to much excuse for jule she mess up simple she really do mess with rue s mind and emotional being if they be mean to be then they will be together in the future when they be both good but right now yes they be extremely toxic rue be to dependent on jule I mean home girl didn t even go pe and jule go from be in love with tyler right into a relationship with rue and be deal with to much right now I hope in the end the show be really tell tenager relationship like this be not suppose to be ship in real life rue jule be toxic nate maddy be toxic nate jule extremely wrong and horible but it be ship and romanticize",
          "this be what I think to before see another theory that they would not end up together this be before episode I gues I want to be really open with the idea just in case I would love for they to stay together I gues the fact that jule be not really open with her dad it be ok not to share every personal detail about their relationship but it sem like she might be ashamed and the guy from rehab talk about how it would not last get to I it would actually be genius if the show put all this potential foreshadowing but it actually work out in the end by the way go look at the other theory if you have not already I actually think they have really good point about they stay together",
          "I ve be re watch the show and I find all the shot of lexi just longingly stare at rule a bit to intentional to be just meaningles there s practicaly one of these for every episode plus that conversation at the carnival with rue s sister sem strange to I even when I first watch it rue be in love with jule don t you think I haven t really think about it proced to sadly stare at they I do not know I may be read to much into it but I find it interesting since we don t know that much about lexi yet other than the fact she s a literal pure angel this sem like it s plausible so far",
          "I love that the show center around rue I think if it focus around jule it would be a show about a transgender young woman s experience but the show be about addiction rue be the addict",
          "the name a hot take I never think about that but I be always ify about this rue and jule relationship rue really latch onto her quick and sem to not be able to do anything without she",
          "true some people want so bad to jule and rue to be together that they can not see the whole panorama they refuse to look dep on thing",
          "I mean I get the sense suicide be go to play a major point at some point",
          "from the moment I see jule ride her bike I know I be go to be with this show for a while",
          "neither of they be go to die and even though they do not know before they end film she probably would not have say she want more scene two week ago if they end on bad term we all know the relationship be toxic sometimes but it be also just like any other intense high school relationship they love each other and care deply for one another they have not even get a chance to explore that in a relationship so it be not end just yet",
          "jule act like they be in a relationship though and she know that rue feel they be in a relationship",
          "this episode be mean to highlight how imperfect their relationship be despite how much they may care for each other they stil run away from their problem and miscomunicate rue either shut off and or start do drug and jule physicaly run away and cover it up with quick thril I e sex with stranger until they have some real growth both of they not just rue cleaning up and actually sincerely talk to each other these high high and low low will continue to happen in their relationship moreover they re stil not together until we see a explicit confirmation of their status then each be free to do as they want though I didn t consider it cheat I didn t like jule do that and I didn t like that text at the end but it s certainly in character for she she s be through her own shit and she s try to cope with the fact she comit a crime under coercion I didn t like she drink her ass off at a party after be so forthright rue need to stay sober but it tie back to their miscomunication issue and the fact that jule have semingly not rely on anyone on a long time I hope it can be adres for some real development on their part",
          "the thing be hunter say that they do not know how be go to end when they be film that mean she do not even know how be go to be in s the fact that she ship rule do not mean anything everyone ship they I do not know why because their relationship be not that healthy but I do not think the director be go to do what people want I believe he be go to do what he think be more realistic and I believe rue be go to die maybe that be what jule presage or maybe they will be together in next season maybe even jule die at this point anything could happen",
          "anyone else feel icky about that kind of like the girl take advantage of jule she get jule really high and then when jule want to text rue the girl say she should not then when jule do kis she she say \" only one more kis \" the whole time they be together all jule be think about be nate and rue to I it just sem like she take advantage of jule be high I could be wrong",
          "you read my mind these be my placement for the character to lol jule be def an aqua though she radiate aquarius energy lol",
          "can t blame jule for rue she didn t help but it be make clear throughout the season she be substitute one addiction for another I also don t think she relapse I think it be a flashback",
          "I think it be definitely romantic love for rue",
          "yeah I be think that to but I be sure there be a bit of physical atraction as well remember the first time rue see her bike jule definitely catch her eye then",
          "not pay atentionhonestly how before this episode there be zero to no sign that jule have romantic feeling for rue besides the kis which happen after an emotionaly traumatic moment with someone she think she be \" in love \" with",
          "I can t point to a definitive moment on scren I gues it s more like to each their own and you believe what you want to believe in you know it s more unconscious procesing I think like a lot of people think lexi have feeling for rue but I don t see that at all some people don t see jule be romanticaly atract to rue but I do that sort of thing",
          "it s not empathy so much as it be just know that people do stupid shit sometimes and project someone else s issue as a reflection of your perceive relationship with they be toxic af rue doesn t love jule because of the way she dres or because she s touchy and flirty with her just the way ana only see jule as some kind of idea of hyperfem sexuality and not as someone she want to live a well life for",
          "lexi be a good friend for stick up for rue against that girl who say she s get brain damage",
          "but what an incredible feat for rue to realize that at posibly her last chance to do so it take gut to walk away from jule",
          "I could kind of see her replace jule as rue suport person if thing go leave betwen the two",
          "I don t believe they re endgame but I think they be go to be together for a while after rue and jule separate and rue lean on lexi be i the only one",
          "be that as it may besides the kis that jule give rue after the meting with nate what imply she s get romantic feeling for rue",
          "amp xb I love jule s makeup it really highlight the stres and turmoil she be go through she look rather unhealthy and unhinge not like she usualy happy go lucky self I really wonder what be kep jule from tell rue her secret about \" tyler \" and nate what be the bad that could happen lexi be here kep everyone safe and be the only thing kep literally everyone and everything from fal apart like you go girl the pol scene where rue be contemplate whether ali might be right because \" this do not feel good \" break my heart when she start kind of whispering to jule to stop you can hear the desperation and fear in her voice it break my heart when she get out of the house and lexi ask she what happen and rue say \" I be a burden \" it break my heart I be notice an almost reversed growth in both rue and jule when you compare they both at the start and now at episode we can see rue start out as be mess up and not even bother to try and stay clean and now she be really work hard at make amend with people and stay away from drug and alcohol protect gia make sure jule get home safe on the other hand jule start out really hopeful and bright and now that she be get so much shit throw at she she be start to fray and give in to the presure it start out as rue counting on jule to stay sober but now I think rue be play the role of try to get jule back to be normal again and face her problem I wonder what make rue cry I know it be because of jule but why exactly I can hear the reasoning in my head but can not quite put it into word be she woried jule be not who she think she be do she feel like jule be change do she feel like she have lose jule and jule do not care about she anymore rue confronting roy or troy about gia make I laugh more than anything else this episode I love when we get to see her protective side when it come to her little sister rue apologizing to fez break my heart and when they both say I love you I be really sad about rue and jule they be both hurt and they do not comunicate with each other for some reason I hope the next two episode will involve they actually talk to each other about their need and concern about their relationship the verse take from romeo and juliet in the pol be such a nice touch I love that they do that if anyone be familiar with the game life be strange a similar thing happen in the prequel before the storm and it bring back nice memory for I",
          "sorry where be we get this thing that jule tell rue she want to live with her I feel like we be mis an important piece of narative here rue be get more and more adicted to jule and we can tell that in her ever change story with that thing which be why I think it kep come up for example in episode one rue say that jule tell she that when be a kid she want to live with a good friend she have not met yet but she know they would get along then in another episode she admit that jule probably should not have say that to her then last episode rue fully insert herself for the first time in that fantasy now she be say that they even talk about it which be complete bulshit she just can not admit to herself that she be obses with jule I think jule be clearly go through a lot weirdly enough I feel the most related to her character I be not white not tran not even american yet I feel like I have similar experience the last image on this episode be so heartbreaking for I because I can completely relate to her feel like the weight of the world be on your shoulder have to cary not only herself but someone else entirely publicly she who can not say no let we just kep in perspective that rue be not reliable she be an addict and a liar and jule be only human to also this be not what she want she just want a calm life with a good friend but honestly there be not such thing with addict no one ever want that",
          "that be what I be think but it almost sem strong than just that maybe rue just love hard when ever she chose to love at all",
          "I think the kis betwen rue and jule in episode be towards the end or maybe the midle in one of the preview jule be see with she make up and mascara run down her face with the wing in the back her hair look wet to that have to be after the pol scene and after we see they walk down the street in the trailer for next week also if they do break up next week they will probably reconcile pretty soon because they go to this dance together which be see from one of the trailer and they look pretty happy I think that be from episode th the finale there be also this scene where they be bike from that same dance episode",
          "I just hate mis thing I wasn t expect a particular reaction but it strike I as unrealistic to have no acknowledgement of it at any point by rue edit and in case you be wonder I don t think a reaction be require or that jule be tran be some kind of issue that need be acknowledge it just strike I as unrealistic for the fact to be unremarkable to rue in the world the show have create",
          "its not jule fault she s not lead she on rue be just latch herself on to her other people have say that this be actually really comon with addict",
          "I think lexi be go to be the one to help pick up the piece when rue and jule blow up if they do",
          "rue s vo do say I don t know why jule didn t trust I so it sem to imply that rue will find out eventualy I be gues it have something to do with her mother abandon her she might have trust issue with woman in general",
          "what do outgrow mean you mean that rue be become more mature than lexie genuine question english be not my first language",
          "be jule even bi sem like she do rue as a slopy second",
          "even more reason to push rue away if she want to she be pretty rude to lexi",
          "by the end of episode I feel like they will reconcile with each other because I think prom or homecoming be the finale and they go together there be two scene in the week of head trailer show they dance and arive at the dance they look happy also look like they be go bike in the same episode from an another scene in a trailer to after the dance so whatever happen in episode betwen they probably will not afect they that much but something drastic will stil happen in the finale though",
          "jule definitely know and enjoy how much control she have over rue she totally bask in the adoration and use it to her advantage yes she be a tenager but regardles that be pretty hard to swalow",
          "jule and rue s relationship have have some ambiguous moment e g spon cudle slep in the same bed hold hand at school etc I think some people interpret that as flirtatious behavior none of the other female friendship on the show look like this jule be physicaly afectionate with rue quite often so I think that be where the shiping interpretation of jule ' sexuality as not straight be come from",
          "oh god the whole \" let I make it up to you lexi \" scene be so sad to I imagine get a text like that from your bf that really be not your bf anymore but that be literally the extent of your social life expect she to make it up to you in some nice way ge I do not know maybe som quality time just the two of you but no she bring along the person who she replace you with and the way it be shot really show how lexi be third wheling example how we see rue and jule skating and behind be lexi just ugh my heart",
          "nobody literally nobody rue it all start when jule move to town",
          "feel exactly the same however I do not think their relationship will end up well just pray and wait",
          "eh I feel like jule be have a grand old time I be more put off by she tell the girl that she remind she of rue when she be literally nothing like rue aside from be part black",
          "honestly the trailer make I think rue and jule would get together so come into the show I think they d be a thing it wasn t until I start watch that it become obvious it be one side",
          "neither of they be right for each other",
          "she say good friend but never specificaly say it be rue it could have be someone else in that same scene rue mention something to the efect that it be a bad idea it s almost like it indicate that it s probably go to end badly betwen the two there be a scene in the trailer where jule be wait to get on a train I m gues she leave town in the finale and leave rue heartbroken maybe she decide to skip town because of the stuff with nate and his dad I do not know",
          "no doubt I think jule be stil try to find her place in the preview for it show rue and jule kis underwater and happy so I wonder if jule figure out what she want or if this be where rue unreliable narating come into play",
          "I think platonic she s jealous that rue be spend all her time with jule n no time with she",
          "I know I be super late but there be many thing that hint to she be into rue not necesarily gay but maybe quer plus I think she may also be gay okay so first off in the cherleading pep rally scene in the cafeteria in the first or second maybe third episode everyone turn to look at the person they like maddy look at nate or vise versa kat look to ethan rue look at jule and lexi look at rue in the scene where they french kis and lexi kind of freak out be kind of strange when gia mention specificaly to lexi that she think rue be in love with jule you can tell she get a bit uncomfortable and the show would not just casualy put that scene in for no reason so lexi mention she be never be into two guy at once which could mean she do not like guy or she be posibly ace while yes this could all be \" reach \" as you say in your other reply year ago lol there be many hint that indicate she probably like rue",
          "wait actually no the reason I and many people think lexi like rue be bcus of that random ass conversation gia have with she about her noticing that rue like jule and her stare longingly at they it sem so random that it look like it be try to introduce a point and even then there be a scene where everyone in a class stare at someone they like and lexi stare at rue while jule have give no sign that she like rue or even hint like that like the one mention above",
          "because of jule and rue since the moment they met my gay little heart be rot for they after last week I be sure the show be not go to go in that direction and though it will likely be short lived and may be incredibly unhealthy for both of they they be so damn cute together I really want it to work out",
          "how do that give more reason when most people be drunk they get pretty handsy mean with friend they show more afection and all lopy and most people do not and what do her rudenes have to do with anything",
          "dang I didn t think of the trust vo like you mention though jule really only freak out when lexi tell she she s the reason so I do not know",
          "I think jule do love rue the same way but its just complicated because she be just now realize that she basically have to take care of rue which be a lot to handle but I do think she love she the same way",
          "seriously she didn t even act as a friend would leave rue who be clearly in distres just to have some fun seriously I love her character but be truly disapointed with how imature and selfish she be in this episode also she fal in love with pretty much with anyone",
          "jule and rue s relationship be haphazardly build on rue replace one addiction for another and jule need comfort after be catfishe in a humiliating and intimidating way that end in blackmail the show portray it as such but some people in here look past it",
          "everything hunter have be say in interview make it sound like the relationship be real for jule she s talk about a shift in jule s sexuality stay away from man and be excite by play a trans character in a quer relationship because that doesn t happen often on tv so I don t think this be lead towards jule realize she only want rue as a friend xb I think their issue be definitely the presure jule feel on kep rue sober and the secret about nate she s kep from she she s scared of what s go to happen to she if nate decide to fuck her life up and she can t even talk to her good friend girlfriend about it because she s terify of anyone find out the truth on top of that there s the presure of be so important in rue s life I mean she nearly die in episode and jule be pretty shake about it she doesn t want to be responsible for rue oding again",
          "amp xb baby rue amp lexi vs teen rue amp lexi sem like skating be kind of their thing I m a rule shiper but this be swet",
          "I just feel like it be to convenient and \" soap opera y \" if they actually be relate",
          "I notice it to and if you pair it with lexi s conversation in the bathrom when rue have a panic atack I do think your old friend know who you be dep down it also could be a reach",
          "I want they to be together as friend I really hope they do not go the relationship route it would just fuck everything up",
          "you know you re right jule and rue be toxic and jule texte rue after the night will only continue to fed into rue s emotional instability and dependence on her she have her own problem and I get that but continue to fuck with rue be not go to end well for the both of they until rue become sober for herself and jule graple with nate her relationship to womanhod they should at most be friend and nothing else",
          "I think rue cry because she realize the meaning behind what jule be say through the word of shakespeare and it make she feel like she be a burden and jules wasn t ready for that kind of presure",
          "no it just mean she s a friend from childhod that she doesn t hang out with much any more",
          "I be not try to freak out or something and I do not even know why but I just feel all your word you make I see the big picture and I get what you be say if they end up get in a relationship they would ruin the special bond they already have and that be not the point the need one another in another kind of level like I do not know fuck I be to high I be sorry my brain be work slow asf and I can not even think right ' the conclusion be that you just make my night",
          "jule also know how rue be go to react she know sadly rue have become dependet on her jule be the reason rue stop consume and if she tell she how she feel rue be go to relapse let we mot forget jule be only and need to live with her shit and someone else s shit",
          "I want more of rue and lexi they be cute and their relationship be healthy for rue",
          "rue got second choice it be unlikely that you ll be happy with someone who second choice you",
          "okay maybe not a theory but kind of like my interpretation when rue come to jule in the pol she try to get she to come out of the pol then jule start recite shakespeare and what the verse basically mean be that she like rue but this be move to fast and maybe right now be not the good time to be together but some day maybe they will be right for each other after she finish say that rue think to herself and maybe ali be right because this doesn t feel good she then whisper to jule to stop this part really hurt for I you can hear the fear and desperation in her voice as she s ask jule to stop in my head she s no long ask jule to stop her act and get out of the pol she s ask she to stop talk like this stop say that thing aren t work stop be so drunk because I know you re do this partly because of I prop to zendaya because her delivery on stop okay can you stop stop stop stop that be like a knife that twist in my heart",
          "jule be absolutely a girl",
          "rue walk off on lexi just as jule have on kath rue and jule be big big personality with heroic quality but let s be honest about it both can be totally inconsiderate I love they but they re a little chaotic and very undependable",
          "lexi be a character that I want to see more from I like she and your theory be",
          "true but could that be part of rue be an unreliable narator and totally mis the sign that lexi be into she",
          "yeah I think that be what the show intention be from the very begining like rue be go to like jule as more than a friend and I don t know maybe jule will be oblivious to it and rue will be to scared to even tell she how she feel I do not know",
          "I actually love the rue and jule part I think that be the beauty of the show though everyone can find something in the show that they relate to in someway or that they find interesting",
          "the only thing they have in comon be how guard they be with mj she bring she guard down a little when she realise how much peter care for her and with rue she do the same with jule diference be mj be more emotionaly strong and independent than rue and I m say this because there s be hint about mj s background of not have a great home life so she s learn how to look after herself and be strong example the mace and also how she have a way with scare people off with her word rue on the other hand always need to rely on something to suport herself first it be the drug now jule",
          "well I just take what rue say from her narative so that s where I get it from but I also agree on rue unstable narative I also asume that from the initial hapines when they be slep with each other jule truly mean what she tell rue in the begining",
          "to I lexi be one of those friend that everyone know and hang out with but only when they have to convince their parent of something from what we have see lexi be pretty \" stable \" compare to the other character so it would not surprise I if she be one of those character that tag along",
          "I imagine her reaction be more towards rue being in love with a girl as opose to jealousy they ve give no indication that lexi be anything more than a childhod friend",
          "I go entirely the other way with it first off jule didn t cheat on rue we ve never sem they even oficialy acknowledge that their a couple or talk about expectation of fidelity or even really define exactly what their relationship even be now sure that could have happen off scren but their lack of comunication wouldn t indicate that to I regardles this wekend away be exactly what jule need to realize how much she truly love need rue as a foundation in her life we can tell she start feel overwhelmed by rue s codependency as well as her perceive responsibility for maintain rue s sobriety all while deal with all of nate s shenanigan that s a lot for anyone to handle let alone a kid handle their buding and evolve sexuality despite it all though she find herself inextricably draw back to rue as the sole place of constant comfort and suport be it selfish be it toxic nope it s just home for her and that s be such a new and slightly terifying notion she s be come to term with but now that she see her past lifestyle and curent problem don t dimishe her afection for rue all her hesitation have give way to acept everything rue mean to she",
          "its really exhausting keping up with rule last week I definitely think rule be not go to make it but now after the last scene and the scene from the trailer I think there be some sort of hope jule be definitely go through an epiphany not only about her sexuality but also with her feeling towards rue become more aparent rue be also become more independent and not so relient on jule when she be at her low point we can clearly see that when she mention that she need to go back on her med to her mom rue be become more mature and in control of her welbeing and all around and jule have take her time to proces what she be feel and now have I hope a definite decision when it come down to her relationship with rue this also go into retrospect with the romeo and juliet line that jule recite at the pol last ep ' although I joy in the ' jule mention that she like rue when she be talk to her friend in the car and even throughout the show we can see that in some way she like rue whether it be platonic or romantic ' I have no joy in this contract tonight ' jule sem out of place with she and rue s relationship especially after the thing with nate and everything go so fastit to rash to unadvised to suden ' everything that have happen be to suden for rue from her mixed feeling for tyler nate to nate black mailing her to see that she be the main reason for rue sobriety it be overwhelming for her ' this bud of love by sumer s ripen breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we met ' as mention in a separate subredit both rue and jule need time apart to proces grow and come to term to thing s that be happen in their life in order for they to be together at the end of ep we see just that I be rant but what I be try to say be that the romeo and juliet reference do have meaning and rule might probably end up together and there might be some fuck up tragedy come in the next ep you never know with sam levinson",
          "maybe she be just happy that rue be finally happy even if it be bcus of someone that she might be jealous of and besides jule sem really friendly towards she so maybe she be warm up to the idea of like she",
          "I have see so many people ship they and hope they get together and like I would not necesarily be mad at that per say I love fez I think he be so cute but a part of I hope that it stay as a platonic friendship and fez be just someone who genuinely want to well for rue it be posible to love someone that be not romanticaly I would love it if he end up be someone who just see so much potential in rue and do not want to see her ruin her life as opose to a love story betwen they again I would not be mad at a romantic relationship but I think it would be great to see a guy do thing out of love that be not just confine to a romantic dynamic",
          "yeah I get what you be say it feel rush from jule perspective",
          "yes I think once you kep that in consideration of become les likely that there be a conection but I gues we shal see",
          "I absolutely love the mix up that its rue faling in love with jule and not the other way around like I expect when I start watch this show if jule gets hurt I m go to be so mad",
          "yeah I find that a lot of time when people be talk about why rule isn t go to work out they mention that jule be realize she s straight but I think it s a lot more complicated than just her sexual orientation she definitely care a lot about rue and I m sure have feeling for she to but just because rue feel more doesn t mean jule s feeling be any les romantic she like rue but there s a lot of thing go on in her life that rue doesn t know about and rue be also somehow use she as a crutch to stay sober and that s a lot of presure on someone so young or anyone at all for that matter",
          "yeah I definitely think that jule be go to get rough up or bad be that it be only they out I the midle of nowhere",
          "nobody in rue s life have be surprise that she s into jule and she sem to make a realization about herself when she be help lexi practice kis so if they re really so tight that he consider her family I bet he know that she s more into girl",
          "yes I really hope so not go to lie I be excited about this be a scene of her playing detective lol but I have say this before I think rue have a very vivid imagination so I could see her thinking of different scenario as to why jule be act out and then finally put it all together and realize what really happen betwen they or at least get close enough to the truth that jule just come out and tell she what happen because I think jule be have to much of a hard time kep it all to herself",
          "I think the same thing when I first see that scene I didn t expect that jule would physicaly leave but I do see it as foreshadow they take something of a break from each other and then come back together with a renew look at thing it sem like jule excursion really do put thing in perspective for her she want to be in a relationship with rue personally I think they need more time before they can truly be together and have it be healthy but I love that this sem to be where it s head",
          "yea jule basically just fuck that up",
          "I don t think jule be cheat because she doesn t consider her relationship with rue as a thing",
          "the fact that lexi compliment jule at the rink it s because of you it sem like she mis her friend I don t see jealousy when they re at the rink I have that may be go out the window because of this episode but it s build on among other thing rue be lexi s only friend I wouldn t be surprised if rue lash out at lexi for push jule away with her comment",
          "I feel the same way if they get together before rue get her shit together it will end in flame and tear",
          "it would explain how rue know that jule didn t trust her enough and how rue sem to be all know in her naration",
          "I see a lot of similarity betwen my first serious relationship and theirs jule realize early on that they be not forever but jule also do not have any issue with rue jule see interest be be rue s first and it be go to be exciting to be there with she through that jule do not sem to have ever have a relationship with companionship so this may also be a bonus for jule jule will hesitate to do wrong to rue because she do not want she to relapse so sacrifice her own hapines to take care of rue will be a main driving factor for kep the relationship go jule be go to find herself in this long draw out relationship where everything be fine but it be not right either jule will probably make a couple mistake but will see how it afect rue this be where she will fal in line and be a good companion to rue jule realize all of this and be acept it while she lay in bed she can not believe what she be get herself into but she realize that it need to be do hence why she lay in bed with eye wide open while stil codle rue my prediction",
          "jule be also dres like claire dane in romeo juliet",
          "it could be a fail suicide atempt",
          "oh I see stil I would have like if jule show sign besides a kis that be why I say it feel rush if jule have show sign and they get together in this amount of time I actually would not complain",
          "sure rue may sem healthy compare to douche nozle nate but I don t think the pair on they be go to be any good when her sponsor ask she what it feel like when she s with jule and he s say drug this could turn out bad for the both of they",
          "I love maude apatow and I be so excited whenever she be in a scene I kind of get the feeling she be be replace by jule at the carnival I be happy to see jule and rue kis but the romantic part of their relationship sem really one side I feel really confident that lexi will play a big role soon and I be wonder if she will be a romantic interest for rue be i totally off do this feel like a posibility to any of you",
          "I second that I really don t understand the fascination for jule in comparison to rue",
          "ah sorry that be not what I mean I think that his dad record jule since it look like cal be look for the tape and could not find it and I do not think jule consent but maybe that be I asume that he record she but yeah you be totally right a lot of the tape look like they consent since they have face shot etc",
          "I m not convinced that I will continue to watch it but for now I m in there be mystery to it slight tension that might lead to something we didn t know what would happen to jule when she met nate rue s scene with that dealer be pretty nervewrecking I be hope they don t hurt her the show just give a thril",
          "jule so far be absolutely one of the strong character I have see on tv betwen stand up for herself to nate at the party stand up to that same psycho in tonight s episode after the carnival and say this to rue while deal with complete heartbreak betrayal and fear I myself would have completely break down into a hot mess this girl deserve everything eta by no mean be I say she deserve everything that have happen to her she deserve hapines safety love suces respect I could go on and on",
          "just finish watch episode at the end of the episode where jule and rue be both look at nate and maddy walk in I m wonder if these main girl character be close or be actually good friend with each other I remember some episode where rue be casualy hang out with maddy kat cassie and never understand the other girl opinion on this drug addict rue",
          "I think jule be a bit take advantage of it be never really clear that she be into girl especially see the way her hometown friend react when she say rue be a she and then all of a suden there be another brown girl in her apartment that be interested in jule I do not know the whole thing be a bit shady and weird jule and rue kind of happen over time this time it sem like that other girl be on the prowl or something",
          "I love rue but that really pis I off and I m gues roler skating be their thing since we see they there as kid but then to bring jule and go on to ignore she the whole night like bish",
          "lexi have be show to be upset about the and jule together lexi want rue",
          "I fucking love that you catch this that be so col I really think that she do in fact have feeling for rue but a lot of people just do not think that eh and thank for the time stamp omg",
          "but what throw I off about it be that lexi do not sem weirde out she sem concerned that rue would be weirde out I can not tell if lexi be just a kind person in general or if she like rue",
          "gt rue s be bewilderedthe right word for it look when lexi break the kis for I it sem like she be into it but then be wonder why lexi stop also I could not tell if lexi ask rue if it be be like really weird and uncomfortable for she be lexi project her own awkwardnes or what anyone else have a different interpretation of the scene lt",
          "I hope we get a lexi episode this season I m intrigue by her character why kep help this old friend who clearly just use you",
          "no not at all I really don t want they together rue s atachment to jule sem likean aextension of her adictive personality rue need to work on herself",
          "I don t think there s a big issue with jule and her dad underneath it all I see a strong fondnes for her father and a bit of an understanding regard personal space when her dad be ask about her relationship with jule he poke and prod a little but jule didn t want to open up but she smile at he very warmly nonetheles as though there be an unspoken understanding that she apreciate the interest and the reach out but also know he ll leave she alone if she d prefer to kep it to herself just like with the dominantdady hok up he want to know more detail about where she be go but chose to trust her judgment instead of take a hard line it look likely that the separation of her parent be due to disagrement over jule gender identity and that her father take her side and suport she she probably love he to no end for acept and suport her or maybe I m just see what I hope to see we ll just have to wait and see how the story unfold",
          "my favorite character be lexi play by maude apatow who at least so far have sadly have a pretty minor role in the first couple episode it be show that she be the childhod friend of rue and someone who stil care a lot about she even if they have drift apart over time in episode rue come to the carnival with her little sister and lexi then rue run off to go talk to jule and gia go off to see her friend and lexi be just leave there on her own and then never show again for the rest of the episode I do not get why rue and jule do not let lexi hang out with they at the carnival and include her instead of leave she out it sem like nobody talk about lexi on this sub so people probably do not care to much about her but I like the character a lot and I think she deserve well and to be include more",
          "I think I empathize more with jule because I understand some of her problem I be not tran but her problem with her sexuality and her bad love experience make I feel close to she I understand why she act like she do with rue a lot of people throw shit to she because she be hurt rue but I understand her decision",
          "they re just good friend",
          "I feel like jule do not really know what she be get herself into and be just now hit she she love rue but she do not want to be responsible for she and she be realize that rue s well be depend on she now and that be huge for anyone x be a tenager",
          "she be absolutely on love with rue",
          "this I be not against the posibility of lexi be lgbt but I just do not get the vibe that this be some one sided childhod crush even during their kis in the flashback rue sem to enjoy it more than lexi do",
          "I don t I do think jule do flirt back but I be not sure if it s intentional or not girl be comfortable among each other but I don t think they way she be with rue I gues we shal see rue need s a hoby or some other friend outside of she as this show go on",
          "also remember that they be all interconecte kat may have tell her story to jule and jule tell it to rue and so on at some point they tell one person something and that person only tell another and eventualy everyone know they have stres this kind of behaviour multiple time in the show",
          "I want they to be together because I think they make each other well and they could make each other so much well if they be upfront and honest with each other in my experience just be honest and acept of your friend be the good way to go about thing I think they be scared of what the other one will think if they reveal what be make they anxious I mostly mean jule feel presure and hide the interaction with \" tyler \" I think if jule truly love and trust rue she would be open about those thing and find comfort in rue they could work those thing out and kep trust in each other this be just how I see it but I also understand the character be not like I and they be valid for make the choice they do so I can understand jule not tell rue about either of those thing",
          "I think lexi be gay and have a big old crush on rue that she s come to term w",
          "jule be literally the nd most important character in the show nobody be be discriminatory to transgender and rue be suppose to be an unlikeable character that you want to see improve",
          "I be kind of regard that scene I will say that I think lexi react strangely to I it sem like there be more to it than she just be a little disapointed about posibly be ditch at the carnival however I be not sure that it be because lexi be romanticaly interested in rue I think rue and lexi s dynamic will start to play a big role during the later half of the season so it will be interesting to see where the story take their relationship",
          "I be glad this be easy to understand I be try to think how I could word this but yeah I really just want they to have a healthy relationship but it be not look that way if this continue",
          "and it basically interpret to this love be to much for I to handle I m not ready I feel rushed give I time and when we met again I ll give myself to you which could posibly tell we how jule unknowingly feel towards rue jule literally go m i a and leave rue after this night it s foreshadow their situation and future jule go out of town and now be come back after realize her feeling for rue and be ready to start a more serious relationship be I lose my fucking mind I feel like a crack out detective benet",
          "I think they re deliberately make a point of how rue and jule forget about the world around they when they re with each other ali literally call it an obsesion for rue and jule already imagine spend the rest of her life with she it s a really intense conection",
          "anyone else from this thread remind a little of \" shyguy \" ask jule when she start transition and ' apologize ' for be intrusive",
          "not everything have to be so sexualize lmao it be posible that lexi just care about rue as a friend",
          "I be all for rue and jule to get romanticaly together I hope it happen when rue get all blushy about talk about jule to her mom be adorable I just do not know if jule be on the same team but hey I be all about it lol you",
          "I second that I think if jule be try to do the good thing I would fuck up rue regardles rue be an addict who go through a lot in her life for she to end up as an addict she think latch onto jule would be a healthy option for she but it be not I just wish jule do not do she like that in the last episode jule know well",
          "same here but I think I be start to like the jule story the most",
          "I think she will get arest for some shit maybe something to do with fez maybe with jule but yeah we all know this be not go to end well",
          "this be a well thought out theory and make a lot of sense whether or not the conclusion be suicide there be definitely hint that lexi will become more important later on",
          "I know jule feel stuck because she realize she do not love rue the same way rue love she but do not want she to spiral this might be a reach but hunter talk about jule be and enjoy be in a quer relationship anybody think it might be with lexi she be stare a lot and I know she be already feel reject but it feel like a different stare anybody want to add in I be curious to what you all think",
          "contact high architecture in helsinkiwould of go really well when rue be basically get contact high off of jule when their relationship become more than just friendship",
          "you get handsy with people you like want to touch she wasn t do that with anyone but rue xb my point about her rudenes be that be drunk leave she with no filter lexi anoy she by call she out her drunknes and she fire back right away if the writer be make a point of jule not be into rue they could ve easily make she snap at her tell she to leave she alone or whatever",
          "jesus christ I love the contrast of the dad jule dad cal the drunk dad rue s deceased dad one of the thing I wish I could understand jule her dad clearly love she unconditionaly he s there for her she have his total aceptance and love but she s basically as much a stranger to her father as nate be to cal now cal be toxic for sure but I feel like jule could actually talk to her dad without wory about his judgement why doesn t she let he in also I want jule and rue to stay together forever",
          "agree rue and lexi have the history and I think lexi be genuinely inter in rue well be not that jule be not it be just that a plutonic friend can often time be a much well suport system than someone who you be romanticaly involve with especially in rue and jule case",
          "rue and lexi be good friend when they be young then thing start to go bad in her life her dad get sick then the drinking and drug so they drift apart but aparently never completely sever their friendship cassie and lexi be sister so it would stand to reason that she know rue fairly well but would stil only she she as her little sister friend cassie sem to consider maddy her good friend and be close with kat maddy though sem to be close to kat than she be cassie remember in episode it be kat that she call to stay with when she be upset about nate I also see in one of the season trailer that jule and maddy start hang out at some point though this just maybe part of nate s plan to make sure jule do not crack",
          "both but she be get way to dependent on jule for this to end well",
          "could this also be rue be an unreliable narator not realize lexi be into she",
          "all those dick pic weren t to send jule two of they be black dude",
          "normaly I would say that the writer of a highly stylize teen and or romantic drama be make a metaphor out of somebody be behavior but in this case what rue be do be literally erotic emotional transference onto jule there be no doubt that rue fal for jule in a way she have never do so before and her sensual atraction to jule be unquestione the big problem though be that rue be a recover alcoholic and drug addict her brain chemistry be literally wire for dependency on the feeling she get when she be high rue be literally replace her drug addiction with her addiction to jule rue get a similar almost as powerful as fentanyl high from her relationship with jule that be what ali be try to get she to understand eventualy rue and jule ' relationship be go to hit a rocky patch or straight up end and that withdrawal almost definitely will cause rue to relapse in order to fil the profound emptine inside of she",
          "you re partialy right on the rue dynamic but I firmly believe jule have a similar level of atraction love that she just doesn t know how to expres yet I think at this point or hell maybe from the very begining we know the falout be come the two of they be not in the right state of mind to maintain a relationship let alone the rolercoaster of emotion that be rule rue have a lot of grow up to do she stil doesn t really have a purpose yet be a junior she hasn t expres any future plan for education we haven t see she indulge in any interest or activity other than drug use or hang out with her friend at least with jule we know she have aspiration of go to fashion school the only thing rue have say be that she ll folow jule wherever she go that s a big no no she need to learn to be ok with be alone in her own head first and foremost there she can start to develop cope mechanism from there she can adopt healthy habit that hopefuly turn into goal she can pursue in the future then once she s a real person we can revisit rule the thing with jule though be she s no picture of perfection either she s more experienced than rue that s for sure but random hokup doesn t teach you what it s like to love another person and how to nurture a relationship with rue all that experience count for nothing not just in term of physical conection but how it feel to be with someone who understand or at least try to you as a human being rue doesn t like jule because she s tran she doesn t like she because she look the way she do rue like she for who she be and that be something new and scary for jule even without all the nate issue put presure on she and deal with the fear that one wrong word would send rue spiraling into a relapse jule stil doesn t know what she s do when it come to foster the feeling she have for rue mainly because she s stil just a kid strip away all her surface issue and past trauma and you stil just have a kid deal with their first real relationship it s clumsy and awkward and everything be magnify but it s real I ll ride the rule ship until the end of the series and I know it s go to get really fucking ugly but I maintain my position that the two of they be end game it may take time and a hell of a lot of work but they ll find each other one way or another",
          "I think you make yourself clear that this isn t because people be asume lexi s sexuality it s because people be ship she with rue and it go against jule rue nice try though I m glad you show your real reason instead of there isn t any evidence you re reach",
          "watch the interview with hunter after the episode she make it sound like jule be not use rue for aceptance but rather embrace that she do not need a man to love she and that rue actually care",
          "be I the only one bother by the fact that rue cite jule for the reason why she s get sober like you d think gia and her mom would be the reason why since they be her family especially gia be the one who witnes her sister s near death this may just be I I just find it it bite od I mean I do think in a way jule be good for rue but I don t think she should be the sole reason",
          "I think the skype guy be go to haras kat as well also I wonder if madie will end up find out the truth about jule to",
          "I be so fucking excited to see jule and rue relationship blosom the crazy thing about this show be that you feel like you be part of it so wild",
          "be anyone else afraid jule will tell rue what happen in ep I just feel like she already have a lot go on and doesn t need to feel like that s on her to not to mention we haven t see or hear anything from they about any sort of exclusivity or comitment besides friend that ocasionaly kis hokup",
          "if they do become a couple let we call they rexi lol",
          "also it look like jule leave town somewhere betwen episode there be this frame of she at this train station in on of the trailer I do not believe she be run away I mean where be the suitcase or extra bag if she be she be literally wear she regular back up and be wear the same outfit in another scene of a trailer where she be stand in a car with a guy I think she leave in episode and come back after posibly hang out with these new friend we have yet to met yet",
          "just come around this interview where I read a few thing didn t see they post yet obviously a bit of spoiler gt we learn jule s backstory through the open montage of episode it s be describe as heartbreake lt gt we also learn that rue be the first person who acept she without any question and that s why they bond so fast lt gt rue and jule will fight about something and rue will beg to remedy it lt gt and this episode have a well develop twist ending which set up the rest of the season lt source",
          "for all we know jule could have a gender preference she hasn t show any atraction to woman that I can remember but maybe she doesn t and just be not into rue but either way she s not into she I be go to",
          "they be both dumbas like romeo and juliet they nod to it several time in the series swim pol with angel wing etc",
          "I agree with other comment I have see that lexi be atract to rue and her kis she be a confusing uncomfortable awakening to that fact but it could be the reverse that she feel uncomfortable that rue sem so wiling and good at kis she that she want to end the posibility of a relationship",
          "now I m not say lexi be definitely crush on rue but I think you guy be take lexi s response to she and rue s kis at face value lol as a lesbian who be closet all through school I can tell you for sure that the weird and uncomfortable response from she be a textbok reaction for a teen girl who s not really aware or be try not to be aware of her sexual orientation internalize homophobia be a thing folk and plenty of wlw have experience it anyway judge by how acurately this show have portray tenage saphism I wouldn t put it past they for lexi to actually be atract to rue and that that be suppose to be our signal for those of we who would recognize it so I m on board the lexi rue ship",
          "I don t see that it just sem like she be really interested in jule for hok up and jule be on a self destructive self discovery path and take part I feel like they both equaly consented",
          "we see that one when jule be hok up with guy",
          "why would she ever hate jule",
          "I feel like lexi be love in rue but the feeling be not mutual",
          "but rue wasn t dres as romeo",
          "yeah for sure this be always a tricky thing that can potentialy ruin friendship doesn t even have to be explosive but the platonic magic just stop and people slowly drift apart this one thing jule say when rue ask like I I or like he I she reply with either and a smile to I this be stil not intentionaly lead she on but it do mean she s be playful stil not uncomon betwen good friend and like we jule also doesn t know enough about rue in the short time they ve know eachother to realize she s potentialy into her girl",
          "to be fair far as we can tell it may be an issue of incompatible orientation I m certainly pick up those vibe since jule be specificaly hok up with guy online easy as it d be to ship rue and jule I d like to see a show where both rue and jule can be healthy as friend but stil realisticaly portray incompatible sexuality fiction always treat it like the end of the world and I ve never be a fan of thatedit I do hope she figure out it s nate at some point so she can get the fuck away from that though if I be big on bet i d say jule will figure it out before he do and I ll bet that masive birthmark be go to be what give it away I just hope they make it happen soon before some more mesed up shit have to go down",
          "initialy I think she speak in past tense about jule mean that she be likely tell a story about her lead jule to an od jule just wouldn t make it like she do then an episode later we clearly see that jule isn t down with rue s drug use which be when I realize she s talk about basically everyone in past tense kat be the second one I pick up on that hadn t be completely atach to a flashback I think she s in a spot similar to she be pul to the front of her class and be ask about her sumer maybe stand on stage at one of the na met sometime in the near future or could be therapy posibly from within another rehab center a sumer over we see in a moment of what have sem like the bad of her addiction that the memory of her sumer be stil painful for she to recount and she simply do not want to talk about or relive they I think for rue to be speak about these event in detail she have likely open her eye to the severity of her situation and wake up however I be with you on that last bit something be go to have to happen to get she there and it s not go to be pretty",
          "yeah you can tell she be not really close with maddy cassie and kat she be just usualy there and she kind of just want her friendship with rue back and maybe it turn to something else maybe it do not",
          "no I think it be pure friendship and have love for another in a different way",
          "all my prayer stand for they stick up together it would hurt my heart to bad if it happen anything that break their bond apart",
          "to be quite frank a lot of people that comit suicide be see as stable drama free on the outside because if the issue be obvious on the surface there s just a high chance of external intervention in my experience a lot of depresed people just try and put on a mask every day while try to deal with their issue alone until that doesn t work anymore but in lexi s case I m also not sure she do sem at least focuse homework shot but stil something be probably brew",
          "my por baby jule deserve nothing but hapines I m cry already",
          "I never say that the plot line of rue use jule as recovery be bad nor do I not show I do not understand why they be pair together quickly and also they could have stil show she use as a crutch with they stil be friend people can be codependent on their friend just as much as they would with their lover",
          "I be talk about rue fail completely and dependently in love with jule and jule not know what she really want seriously from rue quit drug because jule be all she need the touchy fely friendship the shot in the dark kis the \" high high and low low \" comentary and all the feeling rue show when on the topic of she and jule it be spot on I go thru this exact dynamic with my good friend and while it do not get as far as \" rule \" have there be something there and ultimately my friend do not share the feeling I do so it fal apart just like ali predict in ep be it selfish of I that I want to see rue and jule eventualy break up these thing sem to rarely work out and it would be more realistic give the curent dynamic i d much rather see rue get her heart break but eventualy come to term with have jule as a friend and build her own strength as an independent person because that be what I have to do lol and I think show that on tv would help a grant relatively smal population of people very much in get thru similar shit I think this kind of thing be a trope of be a gen zer much more young people be comfortable with be bi and with that come crush on friend its a problem bi kid face all the time and shed some light on it be so nice to see on tv",
          "listen I be all for they but I have a feel jule will not return the feeling I hope she do though",
          "totally mean jule my mind be overwhelmed right now lol on the topic of rue though she be excelent as well she definitely shine when she s sober but I don t know how long that ll last for her she be always try to protect jule because jule have a habit for sketchy situation they re like peanut buter and jely to each other",
          "yeah but when have she see anyone else she like rue be already a close friend of hers more so than kat who just casualy hang out with her I hate hug people but if I be drunk and I have a really close friend near I I would do the same thing it be not black and white",
          "rule for rue and jue for jule or vice versa only because both of they equaly deserve to be the first part of the nickname",
          "I do to maybe she just look young or maybe I even think rue say lexi have a young sister or something I do not know why but I be with you I think that to gues we be wrong lol",
          "I know that friendship betwen girl be often portray as super intimate but I feel like their relationship so far have be more intimate than usual I feel like rue like jule more than just platonicaly and that it will be a key part of the show anyone else catch that vibe from their dynamic",
          "jule and rue forever if they split or stop be friend I will become a bad person",
          "yeah jule say everyone here know I m trans to rue in the third episode while they re talk about tyler rue talk over her but you can stil hear she and the subtitle say the same",
          "I wonder if she be potentialy who rue be mean to be with and jule be just mean to be her rue s absolute good friend",
          "I stil do not think jule be be overshadow she have arguably the high amount of screntime nd to rue",
          "I m confused af right now I strongly think that rue kis jule because of her afection for her because she s so nice and acept of her I wouldn t judge her sexuality base on that kis she might be pan though",
          "I think I m make something out of nothing but when they be walk home in episode and jule be say how much she like shyguy and say rue be jealous rue in her head say that its shity for she to say and it be not true and how she have be act weird then jule say outloud that rue have be act weird all week be rue admiting that she have be act weird do they both think each other be act weird and jule be the only one to say it I do not know let I kno if you guy remember this part of the show",
          "I suspect it at this point but it be only until they do the backstory on jule lol",
          "you have to read betwen the line because the writer be not go to make it obvious that they like each other",
          "she be the embodiment of \" no one s favorite friend \"",
          "it be definitely a posibility there s a scene where everyone be look at who they like and lexi look at rue",
          "it mean that you grow up literally and with that and your life development you don t conect with a person or a thing anymore",
          "it be a bit toxic in my opinion jule be more so use rue to feel well about the whole tyler situation and ali even talk to rue about she subconsciously atempt to replace drug with jule do not sem like it will be a healthy relationship",
          "a lot of people mention the hunter interview but they do not realize that actor say inacurate stuff about their character all the time I have witnes it to much that I just start to learn to not get my hope from they hunter sem like an inteligent girl but she be not the creator so I do not really trust she with anything regard jule and rue s relationship",
          "since this subredit be easy to down vote anyone with differ view let s get a thread go with different opinion mine be lexi isn t a saint she help rue a drug addict pas a drug test I get it she s a teen put in a bad spot but why be she give leway for be a tenager but everyone harp on madie be an awful person because she s in an abusive relationship and be also a tenager who be put in a bad spot you guy can t have it both way also the hate for kat have any of you ever be the ugly invisible friend that take a tol on one s self estem she find new find confidence despite it be misguide she s no idea what to do with her new find hotnes the way she treat ethan be horible I get it but you have to realize she s be suround by hot friend most her teen year and for once a cute guy she like genuinely show interest in she she revert back to that shity feeling of be ugly because how can she compete with the hot blonde these be thought I m think she may have base on her reaction should she have ask he what that be about definitely but she s a tenager teen act on impulse not logic",
          "so the other day I see this post from euphoria and the caption highlight there get I think about romoe and juliet I be wonder what happen in the begining of act thre of romeo and juliet so I get out my handy romeo and juliet bok and start read the third act sure enough it be the part where mercutio gets kill by tybalt then romeo kill tybalt so I come up with a theory throughout the story I have see a lot of romeo and juliet reference this one be especially alarming so at the begining of the third act of romeo and juliet mercutio gets kill by tybalt and so in turn romeo kill tybalt so in this comparison mercutio be fez tybalt be nate juliet be jule and romeo be rue now this make sense because mercutio be one of romeo s good friend and tybalt be one of their enemy who happen to be the cousin of juliet like in romeo and juliet with juliet and tybalt jule and nate don t really like each other but they be stil link to each other so I think that fez be go to try to kill nate but nate be go to end up kill fez in the next episode how this will happen I do not know but I have an idea its go to be nate and fez in a room together then a black scren we hear struggle then a gun shot and we will not know who die until the next episode but if my theory be right then fez will die then in the next season rue be go to plot to kill nate and kill he this also work because we think that rue and jule will die and romeo and juliet die but hopefuly that doesn t happen also one of the most important theme of euphoria be love and the same in romeo and juliet everything that be do be for the purpose and love of another person and love would be the drive of everything that happen in my theory now if you think that kiling be a little extreme then maybe we could substitute jail or a serious injury for death this could symbolize the death of a character ability fredom or even reputation if they even have a good one in the first place tell I what you think",
          "before you read any furth the post contain a posible major spoiler from the synopsis of the pilot script that be publish about a year ago so if you have not read that stop read now anywayif rue do end up kill nate as the og pilot script say I think lexi will either a help she kill he or b help she cover it up this be not base on anything specific that be say in the show but it be rather just a bold prediction base on rue and lexi s dynamic as well as lexi s semingly grow importance to the story I feel like we be naratively be fol into believe that she be not go to be a major player in the show but she will play a key role towards the end of the season I kind of see lexi as a chekov s gun in a way anyway I might be completely wrong here since again it be just a bold orediction more than an actual thought out theory but I think I would just put it out there",
          "maybe it be because rue never feel the way she feel about anyone else before and jule give she an ultimatum in one of the early episode",
          "in episode when rue be on the couch with lexi after lexi make the comment about do tenager stuff what do rue mean when she say that when she be an adult she wouldn t be able to do adult stuff either I get that lexi be refer to the fact that rue have to be sober at the party but what do rue mean how do you interpret this",
          "I didn t see it at all the first two episode but it be pretty obvious in this third I have a very dear friendship end because my good friend all of a suden get super weird around I and awkwardly confes to have feeling for I the feeling be not reciprocate and after that we just drift apart I have no idea and do not see it come",
          "when she and rue be react kis there be a rainbow carpet in lexi s room I feel like that be not just put there for no reason",
          "I think I be the only one who think this not much happen this episode but I believe it be need as it build up set up next episode next episode look like it be go to be really drama fil I be woried for jule and rue edit I do not think jule be in love with rue it be very one side atm and rue and jule need to figure stuff out for themselves before they can just jump into a relationship lexi sem like she could be in love with rue but I be not sure yet",
          "for that to happen jule would need to be out of the picture and I don t see that happen unles she die",

          "yeah this please no love triangle",
          "I think jule face at the end show that she be begin to realise how co dependent rue be on her multiple people throughout the episode like her dad and lexi kep tell she how she be the reason why rue be clean which probably make she uncomfortable and fearful because that be a huge responsibility and she know that if she hurt rue she will overdose or relapse if have nothing to do with her romantic feeling for her I also think that jule feel presured to be in this serious relationship with rue even though she be never be in one before and because her past encounter with man be always one off nothing more so to go from those situation to this comit one be probably confusing for she to the conversation about how many guy she have hok up and why she do it play into this theory plus if jule kised rue last episode because she be vulnerable like some people be say why do they show that montage of they it would be useles if that be the case",
          "agree I also don t exactly want they together honestly I apreciate how complicated their relationship be I really apreciate rue s character be a wlw but it wouldn t ring true to I for they to end up in a long term relationship unles their dynamic be to drasticaly change in the come eps I feel like the show do a great job of depict this kind of wishy washy semingly unrequited love and it definitely resonate I don t think take that to its realistic conclusion make it les real of a relationship",
          "completely agree as well I really apreciate that they be able to get a piece of lexi s story acros to we with those subtle instance it make she apear as insignificant which be exactly the way lexi myst feel herself this show be so briliantly write film",
          "there s no doubt that everything go on with jule be go to come to a head base on how zendaya and hunter talk about the character be home for each other and kind of a light in each other s life I do honestly think rue be go to at least try to pul jule out of whatever be go on the same way jule inspire rue to get clean I m hope they can work through their co dependency and be positive force in each other s life but we ll see",

          "they be in a codependent relationship but that do not mean that jule could not have consider rue s feeling and situation she literally tell rue not to wory about leave her medication after rue sufer a life endanger depresive episode she absolutely could have go about thing well I stil do not hate the character but right now I be not a big fan",
          "I think we re dance on the line betwen consensual and inapropriate jule may have be okay with it after it start but initialy she didn t want to hok up and she be high out of her mind",

          "and jule be cry",
          "I think its interesting how jule be the one who fantasize about live with rue for the rest of her life but then she slowly start to realize that she doesn t want to be anchor by rue like ali say it s inevitable that jule be go to break thing off it s just wicked sad that you see how rue be tell her mom and the na group about jule and how she love her and how jule tell her dad that they aren t a thing and then she freak out when lexi tell her rue be well because of her its like jule get what she want and now she want do ditch out",
          "I think the dynamic betwen lexi and rue be that they re two friend who have grow apart sem like lexi be happy that rue and jule be hang out but also sad that rue doesn t have time for she anymore",
          "jule infp where she nowhere near it she be more of an esfp",
          "no sometimes friendship can be magical at least on tv do people really need a reason to have a friend of course a friend you can cudle in bed with be a plus right",
          "I be rewatche the first episode and when rue be at school in what I be asume be a lock down dril a guy be point a video at she and make lewd gesture not sure if its she in the video or not it would fit with what we have see with other sexual encounter film and use to shame girl in the show also she mention nate try to finger she at a dance without her permision that be say I absolutely do think rue like jule as more than just a friend she sem very enamored with she",
          "they be kind of together though I dislike how lightly this show deal with cheat",
          "I m see people say lexi be to boring to have her own episode but do you guy think that s true because to I there s so many thing the writer can do with her character and they already hint at lexi bring in love with rue but there s most definitely more",
          "in episode two during the pep rally scene lexi look at ruerue be at the table with julesnate look over at madydaniel towards casieand finally ethan towards katwhile it hasn t be make clear with lexi rue nate daniel and ethan all have some sort of romantic sexual interest in the character they look towards and acknowledge albeit all be dysfunctional relationship what do you think about this I see this as more evidence towards lexi be into rue some foreshadowing for what s come next",
          "be jule ' love forbid though I mean I can see the conection but I also do not we be mis the interference from the family in fact they have be wholy suportive from what we have see as well as the incitement that would lead to that sort of tragic ending do I think euphoria will be some sort of tragedy yes do I think euphoria will miror r j no",
          "I agree plus when they kis lexi sem unbothered while rue be like I think I m into this",
          "something I notice more upon rewatche episode last night be that during rue s apology she catch her breath when jule hug her like sure there s the exhilaration and nervousnes of be so close to someone you re atract to but her anxiety of hypothetical scenario where jule gets murder during a hokup or never want to speak to she again be disolve almost instantly every other time rue have have an anxiety panic atack she s need or turn to drug to calm down but she s find relief in another person be it healthy to rely on someone as a cope mechanism not entirely but it s well than substance abuse for the time be with jule it s a bit more complicated we haven t see her character episode yet but from my own perspective I see she as just look for aceptance not in the sense that she want people to perceive her apearance as female as a transwoman but who she truly be as a person every kid struggle to find their own identity and I d imagine its exponentialy more dificult for someone in jule position from the moment rue see jule on her bike to when they oficialy met at the party I feel like rue have acept she stil not sure if rue s intention be always romantic or if it s a by product of be a tenager and an addict but regardles rue see something in jule that I do not think she jule see in herself she doesn t present as depresed or shy but there be obviously past trauma she s deal with in adition to be new at school and not to mention be tran so she probably feel defensive at all time be imediately and totally acept by a stranger must be shock so its understandable why the two of they form such a sturdy and fast bond whatever the falout of rue s kis and jule future hokup misadventure might be and wherever rue s atempt at sobriety and jule orientation evolve into lead this will be one of the most interesting relationship dynamic I ve ever personally see in television or real life can t wait also I definitely ship they as a couple but certainly would not mind they stay good friend as long as all their card be on the table in term of expectation and intention",
          "can you give I an example or sign that jule have romantic feeling besides the kis she give she after have that traumatic moment with nate",
          "this episode kind of confirm for I that lexi genuinely care about rue more than a friend I be go to especially after that flashback kis scene I think that lexi will be the one there to help rue when everything go to shit with jule what do you think",
          "source anyway that be super disapointing to hear since lexi s one of the more likeable and compeling character at this point in the show I be go to",
          "ya I definitely feel you on this I think we see that they have move past it in the next episode and I do believe jule have a lot of compasion for her they be relationship be complicated but they both care for each other so that be good could not handle if jule do not \" get it \" plus would not be great for the story line I think we be go to see a lot more go on here and hopefuly rue will open up more instead of run away that be life it be not always so black and white",
          "yeah they should stay friend but hey it s euphoria so they ll probably be together and will not realize it s a bad idea until their relationship turn fuck up",
          "I could see that for sure I interpret it as her drunkenly recite r j be a subconscious way of expres that she feel the same as rue do which totally freak she tf out for two reason she wasn t aware she really feel that way towards her and be atract to a girl it s a new thing for her I think she be so young when she be send to that conversation therapy bs place then start her transition pretty quickly after that so it s not like she really go through a denial cover up phase where she date date anyone who identify as female I could be totally wrong on that second point since we don t really know that for sure yet I do not know that be just how I perceive it you could definitely be right to we shal se",
          "she explain that she be teach her when she pul away she look at she weirdly and then lexi say \" be this super weird and uncomfortable to you \" be rue uncomfortable I be really confuse by this scene how do you guy interpret it",
          "lexi s character largely be in the background but lately she s get a lot more screntime each episode we get a little more lexi and that wory I for her sake save for last week when rue texte she we don t see anything from lexi s perspective she s always react to something from one of the other character we never see she do her own thing she s pretty much in the background since she s get more screntime as the show near the season finale I think something be go to happen to she she be go to do something that afect everyone else maude apatow have second biling in the credit which be weird for a character that so far doesn t even have her own storyline I think we will find out why she s credit after zendaya by the time the season end",
          "jule she",
          "everyone out here fal in love with rue fez jule now lexi while she s out there gamble with her own life",
          "I ve be think about this show a lot I have so many favorite character like rue jule and fez the person who be inside my mind lately be lexi she may be a background character in this show but I feel like there be more to her character we hardly know about maybe that be who she be someone who be always there and kind to people we all know her home life wasn t great grow up either I feel like we all know someone who s be like that especially high school I wouldn t say I be exactly like lexi in hs but she be someone who I wish I have as a friend because she will be the type of person to listen I do see myself in some variance in she like when I go to hs party I would always be in the background and not someone who everyone really look for lexi have friend but be not their person to go to when it come to other social ocasion hs may suck for friendship for her but the colege life will definitely get well for her I guarante it anyways I think lexi be such an interesting character in this show there be so many way the writer can do with her character she may be a background character but I feel like whenever her episode come in it will be a good one",
          "I think it s just like you say they re set up lexi to be the friend who be go to be there for rue when jule leave I think that s just it nothing romanticaly or suicide relate like other sugest",

          "fez sem like a genuinely great person in term of the character I think it s important to realize that he will not take any of what rue be say to heart I m sure he s hear plenty of addict and tweaker say thing they don t really mean in the heat of their drug fuel pasion rage I also don t believe rue will harbor any sort of true resentment towards fez maybe at first but she will realize he be do the ultimate good thing",
          "he also know that rue isn t ready for recovery if he doesn t help she she ll find someone else who definitely win t give a fuck about she his refusal to sell fent even after he be force to pay double for it make he stand out as the one character so far who s draw a line and stand by it",

          "like I be so happy fez stick up for rue and jule but now I know something horible be go to happen to he and posibly rue",
          "I don t think this add up fez be old then the main character he would have to be the old brother and there would no indication os how ashtray end up with he I think fez lose his parent young and be raise by his grandma but then she start to get sick and he have to start take care of she and his young brother pay the bil and shit that s how he end where he be and eventualy ashtray be wicked smart as he be want to help as well the main character will have their episode and although their story intertwind I think that the main event that define their arc be independent from each other",
          "or kill her lol walt be may more fuck up than fez apear to be",
          "I really like fezco he kind of remind I of mac miler",

          "I asume either his mom or grandma that raise he which be why his little brother just want to stack this money and pay off my mortgage",
          "I literally just have this exact thought about eps if they folow the same patern and focus on character s backstory to start the episode fez s arc most likely end with he sell again to rue and be an instrument in her suicide or od",
          "yeah I be totally get the psychopath vibe just the stone cold expresion on his face constantly",
          "I think fez be close to age with everyone it sem that people know he and his little brother on a pretty friendly level you don t usualy have that with you be drug dealer",
          "the way she talk to fez last episode be god awful and make I hate she alitle more I def think it s a brother sister vibe because if he be just a dealer then he would have say screw she and fed she the drug and if he be in love with she he would have break down and either give she some or atleast have open the dor that be def sible tough love kind of stuff hell he think about kilin a gang afiliate dealer for she to protect she",
          "dude be kind of an asclown but holy fuckaroni do rue end his carer big casualty of night I be go to",
          "we get a post like this every couple of day and people always defend he because he s a fan favorite but there s really no excuse he could sell these drug to adult but he chose to target tenager he s not an evil person like nate but he s far from be the decent guy people think he be",
          "that be the thing from what we have see he be a decent guy people can point out his flaw because all the character have some I be refer to the fact that when someone say \" I like love fez \" people be quick to comment that be he be a bad guy because he sell drug which just be not factual for the show or real life",
          "that be a tough scene to watch I be happy he do not give in to rue",
          "that be what I be sayin I have be think it be ashtray and especially with this new episode where they randomly get ashtray because the mom give he up",
          "fez and rue be easily my favorite",
          "I look on imdb and brynda matox be list as fezco s grandma so I think that s who it be those two kid be on their own pretty much",
          "do anyone else ship frezco and rue I genuinely feel like he love she in a way that jule could never he protect she and want what be good for her to the point that he be wiling to give up a client which be hard for most dealer I feel like if rue really give he a chance they would be great together",
          "fez literally say she be like family",
          "also likely why he drop out of high school pedle drug be the only way he can kep a rof over his head",
          "in episode when rue s mom be make she take a drug test after rue get the pe from lexi her mom mention how dificult it be for everyone after she od d and talk about how it be especially hard for her young sister to find she die on the flor then they show a glimpse of the od scene later at that party fez tell she how he didn t like see she go through all that stuff and it definitely sem like he s talk about her overdose but doesn t flat out say it so I m asume at least he know about it",
          "I know he get a lot of suport around here and the show want we to like cher for he but fez be honestly a piece of shit he sell adictive drug to child what happen to rue be partialy his fault for suply she and pay for she it be not show but you have to wonder how many other kid he have goten string out of course it be more complicated than that he have to pay for his mom s treatment but dude sell to adult",
          "thank I mis that gues fez should be woried because they see all that blood on the money so they ll conect those dot quickly",
          "face tato be really it curious how fez would have let that happen to his brother",
          "well I would not say that everything we know about he be good because he sell hard narcotic to tenager so he be not a saint but other than that he sem nice",
          "no mention of fez and how that one got put off to for no reason",
          "during one conversation with rue he say \" he be to fuck up to be have this conversation right now \" when rue be explain her ocd she also say that fez be \" observant for someone who be not rotate on the same axis as earth \" or something to that efect base on the fact he be a dealer and those quote it be safe to say he be at least a regular drug user",
          "fez be live by survival sure what he be do be not ideal and he probably feel remorse for it but I believe decent character can do not so decent action",
          "yeah fezco hold it down he do the right thing kep a straight face ofer to take care of everything and didn t raise his voice damn that scene be intense I love a show that make I nervous xb I be mad rue for barge in there and act like that her character pis I off at the moment but it s suppose to be that way",
          "I actually think that despite his age and somewhat simple personality fezco sem to show genuinely wholesome and altruistic love towards rue the kind that doesn t involve your typical tenage infatuation or sexual desire he seriously care for she",
          "the \" I can fix he \" trope be not cute and it be get old",
          "so rue would not have become a drug addict if it be not for fez it sound like you be put all the blame on fez and none on the she be go to be an addict regardles of if fez be around that be not how life or addiction work rue be responsible for her action not fez you be take one aspect of his life and say that be what define he as a person if you think someone sell drug automaticaly make they a bad person you need to met more people as far as ashtray I agree he be to young to be involve I do not think we have enough information to put that on fez right now I think most viewer have piece together that fez and ashtray be sell drug to take care of a family member medical bil or their parent could be force they we do not know the full story yet",
          "if you be theory be corect then he s be disingenuous the whole time that s a really bad thing to do as a sponsor and if rue find out that would be even bad",
          "fez just try to survive there ya go",
          "um duh that be pretty much a give do fez have a thing for rue I think so but stil",
          "which be why when rue say those thing to he it feel so unbelievably incredibly mean he do not even try to fight back when she say it to because he feel guilty fez be to good for this show and rue",
          "at the end of the day the most unrealistic thing that could have happen be fez shot nate that would have be a game of throne move to pul all season you have this guy just try to do his good and take care of his family he have go out of his way to help rue just try his good for he to go out and shot nate would not have make sense for this character they develop",
          "the weapon can be plier and a blow torch",
          "agree fez I be go to be in a walter white situation kind of",
          "isn t fez like and adult and rue a minor",
          "omg fezco should ve kill mouse when he have the chance",
          "I think fez do feel some guilt for enable rue in her drug habit I think it s the fentanyl incident that fuck with he he know once rue get a hit of that she s go to want more",
          "I have a feeling we ll get the back story on fez and ashtray in the last next episode",
          "where be you get that he target tenager we have see he sell to rue but he be never say he exclusively sell to teen I be also under the impresion that he be a teen himself so he be not an adult \" target \" teen he be a teen selling to his per I be also not argue with you that sell drug be bad wrong I be just say that sell drug do not automaticaly mean you be a shit person",
          "wait be fez the focus of the last episode",
          "no I do not want anything to happen to he he literally sem like he have this genuine heart and he just want the good for rue",
          "I want a full episode of just fez and ashtray",
          "didn t really sound like fez to I I think it be just part of the song to be honest",
          "doesn t fez sell the girl the ticket for the moly he s ashtray s frontman even at the gas station ashtray be out of sight do the business but fez be up front vet the customer he s work at another stand the girl ask he for moly he tell they she s work over at the pretzel stand and give they the smiley face ticket that let we ashtray know they re good to sell to",
          "I feel like he be so well cast that he remind I of a few different dealer I have met buy wed in my day his little bro be the muscle and fez be the polar oposite it apear that their dynamic work well for their business basically fez play his role as dealer nearly perfect I be go to",
          "my boy fez stay loyal and ground",
          "I can only hope he just beat he up and didn t kill he because I really don t think mouse be go to be forgive about fez screw he up like this",
          "honestly he s one of my favorite character he s a good friend to rue deal to take care of his family and have moral he have every right to sell the drug to rue when she beg himbut he do not because he know how bad of a place she be in and compare to nate he s a saint",
          "not just a rich dr that be mouse s conect fez folow he there",
          "I think rue be go to get fez to fight nate but because favorite character always die fez be go to get yete out of existence I hope I m wrong though I love fez",
          "every episode one of the top comment be how much they love fez lol",
          "I do not consider jule cheat because technicaly she and rue be not even together it be complicated I do not get those vibe from fez I think he genuinely care for rue though it be a little sister big brother type of relationship with they two he be show he be wiling to protect she all he can from mouse and refuse to give sell her drug even when she insult and tell he she hate he I love their relationship and I hope nothing happen to fez",
          "they will definitely include their backstorie in the begining of some episode soon fezco be my absolute favorite character by far lol I be hope nothing bad happen to he throughout the season",
          "I think fez s addiction be to feel like he s an infalible protector for those he care about though we don t know all the detail I think it s fair to say he s a very recently grow up parentalized child he feel like he have to provide for and look out for everybody ashtray his grandmother rue anyone who s important to rue who sem at risk I think it s safe to asume he start sell drug not because he have some fantasy about be a high roler but because it be the only way he could think of to provide for his family when we met he for the first time he s invest in how he can be a suport system for rue and be far to easily persuade to give she what she want in the moment his decision to threaten nate and target mouse s drug conect be pretty stupid from a self preservation standpoint but that s not what he s interested in he almost sem incapable of think about what s in his and by extension his love one s self interest in the long term because he s so concerned about protect they from what sem like the most imediate and acesible threat I really really really hope he s ok next season and his character arc will involve learn that he have to take well care of himself to well care of the people he love",
          "when you re actively help tenager become adicted to drug you re not a decent person that s not how it work just because he have a soft spot for rue and decide to stop sell it to her doesn t mean he s not enable several other kid in the same situation the only diference be he doesn t care about they not to mention the fact that he have ashtray who be even young than the teen he sell drug to as his partner absolutely nothing about this behavior be decent",
          "all the dealer I ve know would go wild about that it certainly wouldn t be ignore bring to much attention",
          "not say what he do be right I totally disagre with what he do all I m say be I can see why he do what he do even though it s be a shity thing to do so while I m disapointed in he I do t hate he or see how he s bad than the douche twin who post kat s sextape online",
          "I don t think he s related to she in any way just sem like a felow addict who s go thru a similar situation and be just try to help rue out he s no nonsense and tell she what she need to hear a the info he get be from ask rue not like he already have that info",
          "I could be mistaken but I think that guy give she his number I gues fez could have take it",
          "you be right I go to far but I do not think he be the saint everyone think he be",
          "I love fez to I think I do misinterpret his conversation with nate afterwards I be like wait do he like rue in a romantic way never have that feeling before",
          "I think they be two of the most interesting character in the show I can not wait to see more about their backstory especially after that scene in episode where fezco close the dor on rue and sem really afect by what she be say",

          "same it s look pretty bad for he to be honest",
          "he say she be like his sister and he be say that hope mouse would leave she alone",
          "watcher from here you be lean towards the right direction in the new episode of euphoria fez be see beat nate until he be unconscious he do not die and it be understand from the the trailer for next week episode but the conection you make with fez be rue bestie and come to her defense it happen",
          "the way that fez handle that situation be some of the good television I ve see in a while he be in a real rock and a hard place scenario and handele it adeptly he sem a dulard and maybe a bit of a space case but he have his intuiton for that character to stick his neck out when it could have be very costly and side with protect rue be a great chunk of character devolpment in a short time span",
          "ugh I feel so uncomfortable for he during that drug dealer scene last night he be a true ride or die friend",
          "fez be super cute and I do not want anyone to hurt he especially nate they be poly just good friend",
          "let we just hope mouse do not try to get ahold of her jez that scene have I nervous",
          "I m not go to completly remove the chance that fez like rue romanticaly just because anything can happen in this show but I think that you be right in the fact that he s take a lot of responsibility of her situation especially after the mouse fent situation and who know fez could be in love and feel responsible for she",
          "I could be wrong but I really think fez be in love with rue",
          "walt would have give she the drug to shut she up",
          "this and he try to cry to that guy in the motel I really like that cal be more layered",
          "lmao yeah they definitely do a good job writing for his character and I feel like his performance be pretty good despite what other people have say from watch his interview after the show and another one he give I think he aproach it in the right way so I be excited to see where it go",
          "I can not say I initialy see but I will be make those comparison now they both sure do have the confidence when they need to con someone into do something",
          "be jule get a pas on cheat because she be a likable popular character I be upset when she hok up in the club afterwards in bed do fez like rue I always think he care about she in a brother sister way but after the conversation he have with nate I feel like maybe fez have dep feeling for rue then I initialy realize besides be self destructive it sem rue friendship be toxic ie get fez involve w nate amp jule drama it also make I crazy that she never listen to fez anyone else feel like this lol",
          "ashtray",

          "when you be in survival mode you have to chose betwen you survive or help the next person get by be at the botom do this to you trust I I know from experience it be not always ethical but whatever it take especially when family be involve sell to kid be probably the reason why fez be so sucesful no little kid want to go to an old crepy man mouse for example and buy something they might not even be educate about plus I would imagine his clientele be crazy and would work more with kid than adult because everyone in the school buy from he and spread the word around to other teen get to get it by any mean most the time when you start live well and actually start come out of survival mode then you have a choice and moral kick in again at that point t I gues it be just a personal decision",
          "act like sell drug to survive be bad than an honest carer exploit worker and kill the environment isn t a good look",
          "didn t he have both he dip that blade in powder and stick it in rue s mouth irc",

          "I know she do know that he care but she do not know just how much he care and he care so much I think rue think he only care because he do not want to be responsible for her death or another overdo but it be way more than that I also think that fez do not even want to be a drug dealer but he feel like he have to to provide for his family and that be what make it even bad for he he see that rue be hurt but he be try to do the good thing for she and even if she hate he for the rest of her life like she say he stil would not give in because he care that much I be not sure that rue can see that",

          "I mean he genuinely care about her well be he pay his conect to basically save she from be rape he be try to get she up out of the house before they get there because he already know something like that would go down he be a good dude and I think he care a lot for she but know how self destructive she be and be a little afraid of anything more than the relationship they have",

          "now there be probably not but damn thing I can say I actually with all my heart dislike about this show and one of they be the vastly know and talk about hate for nate bulshit and the fact that jule an tyler play through with his pyschotic game though they have every reason and liability to put he under and not be take down with it i d just like to talk about fez I love every single character for their good and their bad I love the show ability to stay true to the real protagonist but let we in on everyone ls life and jst how different they be in person and how much we really do not know what be go on behind closed dor what I can not stand as of this moment be the fact we have touch home plate with character I personally think be les valuable to the show or even come close to have a dep storyline than rue and jule aside from fez who the fuck be fez and when be we go to learn more about the man you can already tell from the first moment he come onto the scren at nate party that he have so much to he he be there for rue as much as one person can be before it take their life down with they and I m sure he have ton of regret for the role he play in other get adictie to substance but he know other choice be not his fault I want to know to know how fez become the man he be I want to know what happen to his grandmother and where his family be why he drop out why he sell I want to know who be fez who s with I",
          "I ain t wory bout nothing fez a rider and ashtray be the kiler on the payrol",
          "from a story tell standpoint they sem to be set up rue to have another bad run in with drug if episode be in fact a fezco centric episode why else would they chose to tell his story last it have to be to set up a rue conclusion ultimately there have be discusion about whether fez love rue romanticaly people cite how care free he be about spot rue money why would a drug dealer whose big know motivation be to make money so frely let we rue slide on all the money she owe he it be not because of a romantic interest in rue it be guilt it be guilt for get enable her addiction and guilt for her od and that be what make fezco such an interesting character he be a drug dealer who be tear by his motivation to make money and provide for whomever the bed riden woman be in episode and the consequence of his drug deal on rue s life he play a part in destroy life rue so that he can provide for another life bedriden woman in episode we have see that guilt weigh on he throughout the season from his big brotherly relationship with rue I believe we will see how rue s fate be directly tie to fezco in the episode finale",
          "I be not entirely sure but the guy that fez walk over to be they the twin nice detail if so",
          "fezco and ashtray be my favorite character after rue and jule I be think there be more to fez than just be a dropout who sell drug when we see that sick elderly woman in his apartment it make I think that maybe he have no other choice than to sell drug to pay for her medical bil and provide for ashtray",

          "yeah this be basically my feeling the finale be good but it feel like a bait and switch they kep ratchet up this tension with all the various secret twist strongly imply that it would all come to a head and then it just like never do it kind of cheapen all the work they do early in the season I be go to",
          "california plate on car easy as that",

          "that I m a lil obses with the show I mean I think about it everyday while wait for sunday I watch scene and episode multiple time so I think that s a thing maybe because I relate a lot to a lot of it with rue primarily maybe because zendaya be kill it and she s become one of my favorite actres to watch maybe because of the soundtrack or the beautiful cinematography I don t know but yeah it s probably because I can really relate even with this somewhat grity reality and after watch a bunch of content focus on teen come of age movie and show this one I really see much of myself in it say this when we re only on the third episode be crazy but what can I do hope it stick to the quality",

          "I mean it be open end just for the sake of open end and it be les artsy and more emphasize spectacle as a series finale it would have be completely holow even people that enjoy the finale might be take for grant that it be literally just a music video I don t know about characterization but it be definitely a colapse of world building and the basic tenet of write it be an entire end sequence that be probably sumarize in the script in a single paragraph that signify an issue of all the thing that be right about the season finale the ending be not exactly one of they clifhanger be nothing new and clifhanger as series finale be nothing new like I say that ending would have be a lot bad if that be a series finale it be a lot of style and not much substance and for something that claim to not romanticize the issue it deal with if that open end interpretive music video number be the way the series end it would be consider romanticisize the fuck out of that overdose",

          "I have be think lately about how shiping culture have become a really big thing over the year it sem with almost every show people have a favourite couple they want to see as endgame the reason I have be think about it in when look at discusion about this show be because euphoria sem like a show where the character be not mean to be ship except maybe kat and ethan it just sem that because of the character disposition any relationship with they in it will ultimately end up fail and will not become end game take rue for example if you look at the main character rue have be ship with I e jule lexi and fez while they be great people I can envision they end up badly we know why with jule but with lexi I think because of the way they portray she as be a dependable friend and the fact that she have not receive much character development it sem to I that a rexi relationship would basically be rue be dependent lexi and not really care about lexi to the full with rue and fez his profesion may lead to conflict betwen they because while fez may care about rue enough to not sell her drug he stil need to sell drug to make money if we asume it be to help a sick relative I be not write this post to dump on anyone s ship and I really do think that most people s ship be just harmles fun I lowkey ship rue and lexi despite everything I have just say I just like to analyse theme and plot in every show I watch lol also what I love about this show be it be realistic aproach to relationship and even if you ship certain character you can not help but analyse the dynamic of their relationship and question whether it be healthy or not this show be refreshing in this aspect because I have be see a patern these day where a show where a show relationship pair that wind up be end game and these pairing be so unrealistic and sometimes toxic but be do for fan service and do not really question the fan idea of what a healthy relationship be ps sorry if this be badly write or do not make sense I be write this in stream of consciousnes",
          "the part where he just graze right past the kid intense",

          "oh my god I totally forget about that episode",
          "I think hbo have a problem in general with consistent storytele euphoria s first few episode be extremely well write introduction to these character and now I be sense a lot of fumbling with what to do with the various drama they ve set up this be not unique to euphoria at all a lot of my favorite hbo drama have excelent act gorgeous cinematography but very hit or mis write which can be pretty disapointing",
          "yeah I feel like the drama for they be the halowen episode and this most recent one posibly this last one as well but I just personally do not see it end just yet next season posibly",
          "there be palm tree in the first episode somewhere so yeah asume it be outer suburb of la",
          "I feel the same way I think it would have be explore more and I hope it be at some point whether it s this season or next season",

          "you know something that add more complexity to nate s character that I be not sure if they be try to write but this be how I interpret it be the scene where he flip and tell jule that he bait she all along I wonder if he actually do really like she and conect with she and be able to expres his emotion in a way he be not able to with anyone else he stil have this jock persona and strength he need to show when he be see but behind the texting he could actually talk anonymously behind a scren and be who he want to be then when jule for good reason reject he he sudenly lose the only person he feel like he could talk to so he imediately revert back to his old way of cope with his emotional insecurity by proces his emotion through intimidation to apear strong when he feel weak that coping mechanism can be see at the pol scene when maddy be hok up with the guy in the pol he see her yel at her go to pound alcohol break thing and intimidate people then he chalenge jule be at the party because he do not want people to see that he be the one be reject he want someone else to be the focus of the rejection he want to maintain his image that he be a strong person that be how he deal with insecurity I really think that scene be more complex than just he be fake it the entire time I think that be a real part of who he be he just have to hide it when he feel threaten to I what cement it be he show up really excited and talk about how she be all he can think about and how that be who he want to be but can not then when she reject he he revert to who he have be and go with his backup plan because he be so afraid to be himself it let we he apear that he be just pretend so that he do not have to admit that he be that person jule fal in love with",
          "I mean tyler get himself in this mess why be a year old at a year old house party",
          "heyfirst of all I be a little bit obses with these two to I think the reason why they start chat long after the sex debacle betwen jule and nate dad be simple they \" met \" on a date app so I gues it take time to match in the first place honestly I have already forget the type of dickpic on nate phone I just remember the evian one and I think that the reason maddy know it be not nate dick because it be not that big unlike on the pic with the evian botle d I do not think jule have serious feeling for rue other than love she like a friend I can also understand maddy because I would been in an abusive relationship so yea and I think that nate have feeling for jule and vice versa",
          "start out with rue flashback to rehab and her think about her father from the gif then move onto rue in hospital talk to julesthen we get winter formal where everyone confront each otherthen it be the next day and rue get into a fight with someone mabye nate and fez come to defend her then gt fez shot at nate but acidentaly hit maddy because of the manequin leak lt and the epsiode end with they disband from the scene of the crime",
          "you do make a good point I have think that jule just let it happen because she be afraid and realize that tyler be a lie I figure he do that thumb thing because he learn from his dad and think that be how he be suppose to act he just do what he know and maybe jule like that consider she be interested in ' dominantdady ' I be go to rewatch that scene but I think it be one of the more complex scene of his own iner struggle of self and not know how to act I mean that line paraphrase \" if you do not trust yourself how can we trust you \" because he give she a moment to acept he but thank for your insight man this show be great",
          "I think that jule will find out that nate be just play she have no intention of a real relationship she will then turn to this new group of lgbtq friend and start to somewhat pul away from rue which cause she to become more upset nate and maddy be off again but maybe he admit to she something about his dad or his colection of dick pic maybe maddy see jule and his dad fight or talk at the carnival and put together and confront he they for sure will have to deal with the falout from tyler s beat I just don t see that go away I think it s his dad hold he down but I don t think it be an asault of any kind maybe he have an outburst at home and his dad have to restrain he look like kat dive deply into her cam stuff and push ethan away I think the shot we see of mckay at the pres conference be the intro to his episode it look like it be he comit to play fotbal at whatever colege he be at now base on interview and episode description look like he have a homosexual experience or start experiment with man and be confused about his sexuality which be only make bad by the fact that cassie be pregnant",
          "I think we can asume it do not happen consider tyler be face up and likely would have be face down if nate rape he reference his dad video tape the scene where he be have sex with his girlfriend etc tyler be beat and blody enough that I doubt he would have the strength to turn over onto his back afterward",
          "no he be texte jule before he beat tyler up and tyler stil have his phone early into the episode",

          "I be think this as well it would be the much col twist I think jule panic and reject he when he reveal himself as nate rightfuly so which would explain all the crying after the carnival that we see in the trailer jule perfectly fit his ideal girl list that the show go to great length to describe for some reason he damn near murder tyler over madie he s clearly get some unresolved issue with his dad I think he find the dad s video of jule and go apeshit",
          "ok maddy s not perfect but just as toxic to nate be a turbo stretch",
          "everyone know nate and rue definitely know but I m also sure everyone do",
          "mild spoiler but it be a really col theory that I think you all will apreciatealso I just want to say that I be sorry if someone have already post this theory I scrol for a while and could not find anything since start to watch euphoria with my boyfriend I have listen to the soundtrack on spotify aproximately time I have also just finish watch up to episode with my mom today and I notice something whenever there be a rue monologue about nate \" all of we \" by labyrinth play the ahs and that song be all about do thing \" for the clan \" and \" take it all for we do it all for love \" nate be do thing \" for the clan \" by blackmail jule for his family whether its a good idea be a completely different story he also do a bunch of other stuff for the good of the people he love he beat up that guy that \" rape \" maddy and you could also consider his fotbal team as a \" clan \" and he dedicate a lot of his time and concentration on do well for that team nate will do anything for the people he love and I think that that song be the perfect anthem for he just want to share that since it slightly blow my mind",
          "I think nate have be mess with jule and be plan to hurt she in some way or another from when she flip out at he publicly at that party there may very well be a bit of represed sexual issue towards she that make he want she yet hate she at the same time for how he feel but his main plan be also revenge see how he atack that guy who slep with his ex same type of deal he do thing in a crepy almost sexual manor perhaps will become a kiler later in his life he d be the guy who would slep with a guy then beat he up or bad afterwards everything he do be calculate and plan he do not come acros she by acident online and be plan something bad all that be say I believe if your theory on rue kill he be acurate its probably bcs he do something to jule so rue retaliate in her defense or out of her love towards jule which I see come",
          "I be wonder something about nate and his father s relationship the only picture we see of they on his phone on the wall nate be young make I think he be not around that much yet he clearly go to nate s fotbal game only time will tell",
          "how would rue also know about the nate be afraid of penis in the locker room or the exact weight kat gain during her vacation when she be a kid or nate discover his dad s sex tape colection I think its safe to asume that rue s naration during every episode opener be not exactly thing the character rue actually know",
          "someone will die in the last episode but who if the writer folow the got route and kill off a major character in the first season it could posibly be or not be nate he s euphoria s joefry barathion it s to soon to kill he off viewer love hate on the bad guyrue she s the main character and it would be like eliminate jon snow or tyrion in the first season she s safejule he s the next major player after rue I really can t see he die just yet maddy she s a cunt but her downfal will come later kat I m not sure where her head be at this moment but eventualy the money and curiosity will gethe good of she and she ll hok up with the wrong guy minor character with a good chance of not make it this season gia a good posibility from an od and it would really mess with rue s head tyler I think there s a good chance of he comit suicide because he s weak and he can t handle the thought of do time",
          "I think that it will most definitely be a clif hanger with rule or nate as the posible dead character s I have look over and over at the clip of nate be pin down the hand hold he be smal dark so I think rue take he down not sure how perhaps jule overdose or someone slip her something she be definitely crack",
          "prediction for this finale be fez and nate be go to fight for the gun and in the proces it go off and a bulet hit maddy rue and jule be go to be okay they will talk thing out and then go to the winter formal I be not sure if they will make thing official but I think they will work their way to that eventualy rue be go to be in the hospital due to a kidney infection she will not relapse this finale and honestly I hope she do not at all but I be be to optimistic about it kat be not go to deal with the crepy blank scren dude until next season I agree with everyone that say it be someone we do not know cassie be go to get an abortion cal be go to confront nate about his atitude and perhaps about the mis disc I be super anxious for sunday",
          "rue already figure out that nate have jule ' nude because she deduce that he catfishe she as \" tyler \" she have not on scren put it together that nate have see his father s sex tape with jule just yet because at this point she do not yet know about cal s sex tape colection only when she be speak as the narator do rue know about the sex tape or the actual blackmail motive",
          "so we go can see jule rue lexi and kat in high school in season nate go to colege how mckay right",
          "would love to see rue and fez get that drug dealer who fed rue fentanyl rough nate up somebody s get to do it",
          "not sure about death but something will happen that will make people go omg I forget about lexi watching episode I I feel like we will get a flashback to the carnival and see who texte lexi and where she go after rue and gia bounce mom nate s girlfriend I think you be right about they purposefuly have she be a background character they want we to forget she a little bit so whatever happen to she have more impact to your point about her sister get guy we see she pul the cover over her head when cassie be send nude to mckay two main character at the carnival that get little play in episode be fezco and lexi I m sure they will use the quick scene of fezco and lexi at the carnival at some point and explain they far we see fezco open up shop with his little brother make a comment about it be a good night and head over to a group of guy we have not see he be not see when cassie and madie go to the truck later for moly we see lexi get abandon text someone and walk off be lexi and fezco see each other do something happen to lexi at the carnival because rue and gia forget the budy system who be those guy talk to fezco",
          "you talk shit on lexi of course you re go to get downvoted her situation and maddy s be completely different maddy isn t go to lose everything if she kep date and subject herself to nate think before you post",
          "storey get to go all the way til the end of the season least it s episode rather than kat be get to be unlikeable rue get a pas cuz she doesn t want her sister to end up like her jule for I become a little unlikeable for I last episode and yes lexi as bob ros be amazing think nate and everyone else will get some sort of consequence for what they ve do by the end of the season",
          "I be also really woried nate be bate jule but that be my unexpected expectation my expectation be he want she like he have not want anyone else before",
          "I definitely see your point and I agree that people who be like nate must have the initiative in get well and prove to we that they change for the well somehow what if there be no one for they to hold on to while they redeem themselves no one who believe in they to be well know fully well that nate be unstable I think he need someone someone who will call he out and not just blindly love he like maddy lol sorry okay okay I know nate do not show what he really be to maddy so I can not really blame maddy on that but this be why I think jule mean more than maddy to nate because jule know the true nate I would like to think that somewhere in the plot jule will be able to help he be a well person because some people do not have the strong will in get it together all on their own there be people who be just flat out dangerous to be with and some who be not we do not know what they really feel and for the show to show nate s back story be significant give they the benefit of the doubt if they do not get well then there go their second chance",
          "I feel like everyone be take the I never mind nate until all the shit with jule to mean that he harm jule which be posible but could it mean that maybe they have some kind of positive ish relationship maybe that end in heartbreak but no violence that cause rue to resent nate",
          "that be true but rue s get there her admision that she probably should be on medication be a huge step and once they overcome their curent hurdle such as por comunication nate s hold on jule and everyone they could really blosom into something good",
          "I think there will be suicide school shot posibly an injury by self defense",
          "yep I be very interested to learn more about cal I think a lot of we asume he be violent due to the violent sex and how fuck up nate sem to be but I wonder if he be actually an efective father because he \" live out his life in hotel room \" like he mention to jules whereas so far nate be unable to engage in those desire and instead turn to anger and physical agresion by asault tyler",
          "honestly rue do sem to have genuine feeling for jule however I feel like that win t jule reciprocate those feeling friend zone her jule do really like nate I feel like nate just use maddy for sex and his internalized view on his sexuality which be hard for he to be self aware to come to term with it it can go either way though",
          "nate say \" you drop out of high school at \" or something like that that must mean he be at least or and you all ship he with rue",
          "this be probably the most acurate answer this season will obviously bled into the second that be how finale work some stuff end on a high note ethan kat other thing continue on drug addiction rule problem nate s iner demon and new plot line open up fez mouse jule cal sex tape",
          "he fucking deserve to hear that",
          "nate gets sort into gryfindor due to family prestige and money but be expel in his first year for be catch with child porn",
          "you be a look at it a little to judgementaly nate sure but jule doesn t deserve to have be throw in a psych ward to be blackmail or be presure into take responsibility for someone s sobriety by her friend and family",
          "well now that we see that scene in the trailer for the next episode I have no idea what to think my thought be al over the place and this show be give I to much anxiety I just know it do not look good and thing will not end well for someone hopefuly nate and only nate my main concern be that I do not want rue to start use drug or od again and I do not want she or jule to die I do not want anyone die to be honest except for nate like if someone have to die I be ofer he up lol but I want he to die in a way where no one else gets drag down to his level self defense or some kind of acident but I do not want rue or jule just blatantly kill he because you know that can not end well either",
          "maddy be dance with mckay",
          "okay I investigate this because it sem out of character for rue she say the bit about he try to finger she without her permision then \" and if they be throw an end of the sumer party of course I would fucking go \" she never say she would fuck nate",
          "yeah she be in love with tyler but know it be nate so his image be haunt her she be confused and traumatise that they be the same",
          "nate be not a good person at all",
          "I love see he weigh the option see how this be play out think about the gun try to find another path getting dicke over on the \" please do not rape my friend \" fee fucking intense man though I feel like I would he would have show rue the gun early like \" nah these kind of guy \" she might have take the hint",
          "neither rue or jule be die it be way to soon in the series for main character to die plus hunter and zendaya literally say they can not wait to come back for season I do think jule will get hurt in the season finale though",
          "all great point but it be a tv show nobody would ship nate with their friend or love one but what s wrong with want a show to turn out a certain way fiction be not always a leson in how thing be suppose to turn out for good people so what be wrong in revel in the drama of rot for the bad guy sometimes yeah he be a gorgeous man and they cast he that way on purpose to show why the woman he abuse might stil be interested in he and so the audience doesn t write he off straight away like why do you like he in the first place ew it be fiction and I don t think shame people for be excite about drama in an hbo show of all thing be really fair it be imposible not to notice he s a piece of shit note",
          "yup he be see some shit and at certain point you figure out how the world work",
          "base of the trailer and the picture of that dol that be shot in the chest I really think it will be a random bystander that gets shot since it s fez and nate that will fight they ll acidentaly shot some random girl and be that fez will be the agresor he ll be the one go to prison",
          "I ll share a thought of my own then it s roughly on the same train of thought xb the scene where nate back the statutory rapist dude into the wall and make he get on his kne make basically everyone watch I imagine think nate be about to make the guy suck his dick instead he beat the shit out of he mercilesly rather than sucumb to his internalized homo bisexual desire the hyper masculine side of he his external makeup lash out against the internalized version of himself that he hate and overcompensate by do the hyp masculine thing beat the shit out of the guy it be esentialy a crosroad where he have the choice of let his internal desire manifest themselves in real life or continue to play the part of the hyper masculine alpha male and he chose the later you note that he say you rape she you fucking fagot which sem completely random and likely untrue consider the guy have sex with maddy nate be project himself onto the guy he be beat up and lash out against he get increasingly violent and agresive as he say this because he s try really hard to fight against the version of himself he hide from the rest of the world the fact that he s look to hok up with jule and other trans girl pretty much afirm the fact that he s not totally straight",
          "I gues you be right I just see nate as a pos",
          "yeah have I not know about the rue nate plotline I would never have think rue and especially lexi since I believe she will get involve somehow could kill someone however know that rue be mean to have kill nate and it be reveal in the pilot it could very well be a case of sam levinson chose to not reveal the murder in the first episode but stil kep the plotline I should clarify that I do not think it would be a thought out murder with rue make up this elaborate plan to kill nate if it do happen I think there a thre likely scenario a it be in self defense b she be under the influence or c it be an acident if my feeling be right and lexi s involve I think she would get rope in by try to help rue incase she be in danger I do not see nate go down without a fight or if the death be completely acidental lexi find out about it and help rue cover it up",
          "for the long time I have believe it be go to be rue or more likely jule sem like tran character always get murder especially the good one so why should this be any different but now I actually think it s go to be fez because mouse just drop off a huge drug shipment at fez s house and be go to want revenge for the lost profit while the more imediate answer might be that fez will try and kill nate which may happen the reality be that fez be go to have all his gun and be in a good case scenario under house arest combine with that fez might suspect nate turn he in but he have no prof and mouse isn t go to go after the son of the rich man in town base on fez s random theory not to mention we can tell that mouse doesn t like fez anyways",
          "well no we already see one of nate s brother aron and all thre of the boy be around the same age and ashtray be like so no",
          "this be actually a theory I be work on like people who be in a manic state never get everything right so nate do not kill jule or rue because what if this whole story be rue be paranoid",
          "I never say she do not want to believe that but last episode she be literally choke and slap nate while he be talk like tyler so yeah the idea of he be what she love not nate as a person she say he be a bitch and pusy and want the world to know she do not have those feeling for nate she do for tyler who do not exist",
          "daniel above anyone not name nate I can t agree with that at all ruefirst of all how dare you",
          "the paralel betwen nate and jule fav",
          "I think she be talk about the situation with nate I think they will be fine relationship wise the past episode be the turmoil for their relationship the cast ship they I have see multiple interview of hunter say she want more rule next season which mean they end on relatively good term",
          "never think I would let anyone or anything do this to I voluntarily hope to survive til season",
          "why be I the one who want to know if lexi hok up with nate s initial date its not even important I just want to know",
          "lexi and rue plot to kill nate I know that s wild but I would like to see it",
          "I think the be high part might have make you mis the fact that jule do not know it be nate only we do and jule be atract to man aparently and so far it do not look like rue be one so that be a no at this point there I say it",
          "I be go to she doesn t deserve shit after what she do to tyler and likely also know or at least suspect something about jule blackmail she s not a toxic spouse as much as nate be but she s stil a horible person",
          "lol I actually love nate on this show it make everything so interesting",
          "you go to make I have to go back and watch it to that would be crazy if what you re say be right but nate have already prove that he do some crazy stuff",
          "rue and jule ' relationship be not necesarily forbid but nate and maddy s certainly be cassie and chris ' relationship also have a secretive nature to it all despite or because of cassie s unintentionaly public past kat and ethan also have paralel to r j a misunderstanding separate they until it be almost to late so I think it be probably rash to jump to conclusion like that rue and jule will die a tragic death in s but I definitely would not rule out tragic death entirely",
          "I think the brother be show to be the oposite of cal and nate he be the only person who verbaly and publicly expres interest in jule and unlike his father he actually ask how old she be and then stop when she be to young nate and cal look down on he because he s aparently not as smart or strong as nate but he sem like the only one who be smart enough to not be involve in all their crepy bulshit",
          "I think it might be something similar to his father where they admire people specificaly tran non binary folk that be able to fully expres themselves to the world and not feel the presure to conform they then we sexual intimate relation with say person as a means to feel that fredom themselves without have to deal with that same societal backlash overali feel nate whole warped sense of sexuality and specificaly his own stem from his father lack of honesty with his sexuality and jule be unfortunate like many real life tran woman to get catch in the midle of these man s issue",
          "just kind of sit here think about some of the more unrealistic thing in the show and I wonder if we re go to get a twist that some of the thing we ve see be not true part of I hope no because I think that d wreck the vibe of the showbut it s totally plausible for there to be a moment where we see that like jule be never into rue as much as she d tell we or that nate be much les psychotic than we have be show I do not know the line from episode be just really look like a chekovs gun to I",
          "I like your theory but I do not think he be molest as a child I think he have develop in his sexuality in this way because he be watch his dad s video as a young child see his only link to manhod have sex with man but also be in a mariage with his mother more than likely confuse he he grow up watch these home video like a tv series he know his dad secret code of organization and from what they show we he be fixate on the film that involve man could be all of they so as he grow up in a hyper masculant way he know he would be subject to ridicule for have curiosity and atraction toward man so he hide that part of himself that be until he met jule she alow he to play both side of the game at the same time its his way of mainte his straightnes and taste the forbiden fruit that be my idea anyway he have psychological impresion from watch his dad and want to explore that part of himself this could explain his psychotic outburst as well because even though his dad have a bunch to lose he go about his interaction with jule in a teary eyed way versus nate say ill black mail you because I can not have you his dad have a release he doesn t",
          "remember when rue talk about what nate like about woman and what he do not in the first episode I notice that jule match a whole lot of the thing that nate say he like about woman probably do not matter much to the whole story but I think it be interesting",
          "what if rue be contemplate kill nate but lexi be the one who actually do it",
          "also jacob elordi state in an interview with the holywod reporter that they ll share a scene in the upcoming episode he do say that thing aren t as clear cut as some would like to believe because he say that when they share a scene the audience nate isn t sure what his motive be like be he just say the thing he say to jule because he s manipulate she or be he say they because he actually like she so that imply that he win t be physicaly violent with her xb this episode be also rate as one of the good by critic who see half the series already",
          "nate die rue kill he because he be atack jule she hide and folow jule when she go to met \" tyler \" that be why at the begining of her narative in the first episode she introduce nate and say she never really have a problem with he and that if jule do not go see nate s dad this would not have happen anyways I be call it",
          "there be a leak photo of who gets shot on this page",
          "this be the penultimate episode of the season traditionaly penultimate episode will have a lot of shit go down I m stil on the boat that rue kill nate I feel that tonight we re go to get the memorial scene from the pilot script maybe next week though it would make more sense and I m almost positive the final scene of the finale will have she say the I m the one who kill he line",
          "I think it nate be go to get beatdown hard by cal I be wonder how the show be go to humanize he a little bit and I bet that s how they be go to do it in episode I think cal figure out that nate watch the tape but think back on it he actually didn t he be double check to see that they be arange in the right patern and they be because nate be methodical like that after year of sneak around but in the finale I bet cal be go to find the copy of jule nude photo and he will put two and two together he might just beatdown nate without ask any question or maybe nate get lipy either way dominantdady will be in full efect",
          "thank you I have never say maddy be inocent her action be the result of manipulation like cm on I explain myself already thank you ana",
          "could not have say it well jule be by all acount ideal she be feminine semingly hairles and be fully acept of who she think he be he be grow up with a father who encourage he to be the kind of man that he be with the exception of what he do behind close dor it almost feel like he be live vicariously through his son but do not realize that he be more like he than he could ever imagine nate be just as obsesive and secretive as cal but I think nate be more calculated and definitely more violent his whole understanding of sexuality and love have be warp by have a closeted father mary to a woman he probably do not love which I almost think be miror in nate s relationship with maddy in that the sex they have be very impersonal and that he be more in love with the idea of kep she saintly and safe than he be with she as a person he want to kep she around because that be how it be suppose to be and his obsesive behavior do not alow he to be okay with anything deviate from the norm I think he genuinely like jule as a person consider that he admit that she be smart and a good person when they be at the lake and I seriously hope their whole thing be not apart of some perverse fantasy in which he re enact his dad s sexual encounter although I would not be surprised if it be I do not know this whole thing be fuck I up which be of course the point but try to navigate nate s brain be so confusing lmao",
          "no it be not it be a great vision but you can not change people someone like nate need year of real therapy with a psychologist and even then he may never be a good partner believe I I have think I could change someone I know people who think they could change someone it do not work it only destroy the \" good \" person who want to help",
          "I see your point and as a character perhaps she just find nate to scary to physicaly confront and this take away from her agency however I think it be important to remember she be in one of her manic phase when she say these thing and she can not really be hold acountable for what fez decide to act on I recomend look up how bpd can afect interpersonal relationship if you want to explore this further",
          "she do not hate nate she be scared of he the line be blur betwen who she see as nate and who she see at tyler they be esentialy the same person we see in that texte montage betwen they that he be genuine in his emotion he love talk to she and grow close to her even if he fabricate some of it I do not think it be out of ill will",

          "I do not think rule will end just yet hunter say in an interview she want more rule scene next season so I be asume the show end with they on good term I agree though I think nate be do for because that be for sure fez with a gun and a mask my theory be madi break up with nate before the winter formal which be why she be dance with another guy there and cry in the promo fez pul up with a gun at the winter formal and threaten nate and maybe acidentaly shot someone stil have not conect the dot as to why rue be in the hospital but I be asume kidney infection or something to do with her bipolar disorder not sure about relapse",
          "we know that this episode will revolve around cassie and rue make reference to the mistake that she have have in the preview we know that one of those mistake be that she trust someone she should not have and he take advantage of she and put out her nude and that tape I be think that tonight we might find out who the mystery man be and it could posibly have be nate I know it be kind of far fetched but hear I out we do not see the guy s face at all but so we know that the person want his i d conceal there be also something there to nate s total dislike of cassie it be kind of weird to I I know they have not interact on scren much but think about it the first time we hear cassie s name its nate put she down and try to convince mckay that she be no good I know mckay and nate be good friend but nate do not sem like the type that care so deply for a friend to be like hey she be not your type another go back to the one time they have be on scren together the carnival scene nate hardly acknowledge that she be there he basically turn his back to she and will not even look at her also cassie be very upset after with the just chilin comment maybe she be a little more upset because nate be the guy who last say he do not want to be with she and she want mckay to say it in front of he because she here be a guy that want I when you reject I its like he be go out of his way to prove just how much he do not like her as to why he would then put the nude and tape out well he be a sociopath there be nothing to show it be he and cassie have no incentive to rat he out as she hok up with her good friend man a good friend who we know would side with nate and as we have seen already threaten to destroy she when she talk about the dick pic how do you think she would react to this also just look at his mo you do not think that jule be the first person he get to send nude and thing to if he do it be cassie I think she would have be much more receptive of nate s advance this be just my theory",
          "that be what I say I be say that if the writer be try to show that they show it well but it be incredibly anoying that now the nate plot block any potential of explore their relationship outside of his story",
          "bit of a stretch but I do think jule be under stres betwen the burden of a relationship with rue she s not truly comit to and nate hold his threat over her head",
          "she choke the hell out of nate and throw he against the wall and kis he once the rest of the time she be flip betwen ana and rue she be most definitely realize her atraction to rue and woman also hunter have say in multiple interview that jule realize and be enter a time of quernes",
          "yeah I think it be go to be focus around kat with rue jule find out more about nate shyguy I be hope for more character development with fezco to though he be my favorite so far",
          "in term of raw interest kat sem a little one note lately rue and jule be stil hype and I want to see where they take cassie and lexi as well it s good that we get to let storyline breathe bit and shift focus",
          "yeah I definitely agree I don t think jule have ever have a real romantic relationship so that couple with all nate bulshit be freak she out",
          "there be a lot of comment of people suport nate and jule in this subredit",
          "he s not check I d on all these young guy and girl he s hok up with and secretly tape and that weird thing he say about jule be jailbait when he be fluster after the chili incident I m not sure why the hell he would say that to nate cal know he s have sex with probably a lot of minor who just lie about their of age so he know he s play with fire with that I be go to not the same kind of mess up as molest young kid though eta I gues it be the brother and not cal who make the jailbait comment stil crepy but not bizare like if cal say it kind of skeve I out that every guy in this mess up family be check out jule though",
          "nate fansthat s like be a fan of ramsey bolton lol",
          "I be a bit confused on the scene with nate tyler do nate rape tyler after beat he up they show he get out of the shower similar to the scene with his dad and jule after they have sex",
          "you all would not be ship nate amp jule together if nate do not have a cute face amp a nice body it be toxic that people be wiling to ignore the red flag because the actor be hot you all know damn well that if nate amp jule end up \" together \" he would treat she like he do with maddy he threaten jule amp abuse maddy even though I do not have sympathy for she for convict an inocent man nate be go behind maddy s back and try to destroy life because he can not handle his sexuality along with control she and abuse her it be a toxic relationship with she push her buton jule be stil try to let go of the tyler fantasy and you all take that as an endgame romance be you all mental do ya know what hybristophilia also know as bonie and clyde syndrome and I quote \" hybristophilia be a paraphilia in which sexual arousal facilitation and atainment of orgasm be responsive to and contingent upon be with a partner know to have comit an outrage cheat lie know infidelity or crime such as rape murder or armed robery the term be derive from the grek word hubrizein mean to comit an outrage against someone ultimately derive from hubris hubris and philo mean have a strong afinity preference for in popular culture this phenomenon be also know as bonie and clyde syndrome \" end quote it be like when te bundy be convict and in the court room young woman be clap for he and whop for he I be not say nate be a kiler but the dude have violent tendency I be not say the people on the subredit be a bad people for find nate cute but ya let your lust get in the way and it be kind of concern even if nate realize his bad way and try to be a good person and apologize its to late and also for nate to be with jule and for jule to stil want he that be a big no jule be scared of he and be stil rel off the tyler fantasy ya take it as a glimer of hope for their \" endgame \" even if nate be a good person and nothing bad happen at all and he be acept his sexuality then yeah be with jule but then I would feel bad for maddy and rue",
          "tomy genesis s album energy persona pretty much embody everything about maddy lmao and they use her feature on episode",
          "yeah sorry if it s unpopular she stil deserve love just not from nate she s a realisticaly shity person and a ton of people be nate can rot though",
          "so I believe that this season will end with some kind of violent and traumatic event the show definitely do not shy away from explicit scene which be awesome and I feel like there have be a continuous buildup of presure betwen many of the character nate would obviously be the prime candidate to do something violent and crazy again he have clearly show his wilingnes to be violent and the early scene of he shot handgun with his dad demonstrate his aces to weapon I also believe that there be plenty of other individual that could comit an act of violence both on themselves or other I be woried that two of my favorite character jule and ethan could be injure by or comit violence jule have be put into such a terible situation by mainly nate and rue to some degre I feel like she engage in self harm or comit suicide be posible ethan who I just want to be happy could be a victim or an agresor he be a smal enough role that he could be kill off and he clearly have terible luck thus far in the show but at the same time I could see he getting fed up with kat and do something completely insane it would be unexpected and shocking come from he but the show be due for more shocking event honestly I be anxious for the next episode and I can not wait to see what happen also I could be totally off in my prediction so let I know what you think I need people to talk with about euphoria",
          "the most satisfying moment be see nate get the shit out of he by jule",
          "in episode one its reveal that s nate s dad hok up with jule through a family photo in the photo you see nate s dad a woman more than likely his mom and thre boy one of they be obviously nate but who be the other two boy I believe that the other two be fezco and his brother ashtray I think nate s mom find her husband s home video and divorce he leave the boy with the father I think that be what cause nate to work out so hard as a child along with find his dad video that be his way of cope with the trama I think fezco cope with it by run away drop out of highschol and start a new life with his ashtray it episode one when we first met fezco and ashtray ashtray go on to tell rue how mortgage need to be pay I think this wasn t just a joke because so far we haven t see fez and ashtray parent so I think it s safe to say they live alone lastly if you look at the family photo mention early and look at the young boy find in the botom right of the photo it might just be I but I think if you be to shave his head and give he a few face tat and he ll look just like ashtray",
          "very good catch the name of the main character always remind I of romeo and juliet if this series play out like romeo and juliet somebody honorable like tybalt will die in the series finale somebody unintende probably fezco because he be honorable for confront nate",
          "rue and jule be in a relationship say relationship have sufer because of nate s action therefore rue be afect by it not to mention that jule be her friend and she just want nate to leave she the fuck alone whether or not she and jule remain in a relationship fez know that rue be in a manic state he know that she sufer from mental ilnes and that she be recently sober he know that she be not think clearly and he know that it be a stupid idea he chose to confront nate on his own rue be not force he to do anything",
          "but esentialy nate be tyler I think that be where the confusion and conflict lie in the same sequence she be kis he I mean I clearly do not want to see they in a relationship I think the writer purposely kep this up in the air soon or later everything will make sense",
          "it sem as if you go to the deranged side of that ship lol I low key think that they d be a good couple only if nate genuinely change and act right right now I want jule far away from he even if she s conflicted about her feeling towards he they build a legit conection online and it s clear that there be some unresolved feeling on both part thank to jule episode halucination now jule be try to figure out how nate and tyler can co exist in the same body be the same person and she be go through it it d be interesting if they continue explore those feeling that down the road in season but as of now nate need juvie and some intense therapy xb I feel that the only reason why nate s act like this be because that s all he know even his damn dady admit that his behavior can indirectly be impact his son and even mention at how rageful nate be and how he be probably the reason for that behavior nate wasn t bring up in a home where you feel that you could be open about your emotion and he be also bring up in a household that engage in toxic masculinity xb so when jule come along and he start to feel something for her he lash out because that s all he know how to do he can t nobody can control their feeling he may feel conflicted because jule doesn t fit into a conventional box and he may be ashamed of have some feeling for her so instead of alow himself to feel whatever he s feel towards jule he d rather try and control his feeling by act against they xb right now as I state before jule need to stay far away from he even if she be draw to he due to her feeling I also hope that maddy realize his abuse for what it be and losen his grip that he ha son her nate need to get some serious help because none of his action be okay period however acknowledge that there be some feeling there betwen those two character isn t ship they that s just acknowledge a fact and want to see where that could go only if he change his behavior",
          "wait there be people that ship jule and nate have they watch the fucking show lmao",
          "let I save this post and see if you be right yeah I think that rue be narate the story from beyond the grave but I like this theory well be it okay that I would not care at all if she kill nate also that guy in the picture I don t think we have met he yet",
          "do anyone know if the winter formal be from episode base off the season trailer nate will make it to that episode but they re really build he up as this evil vilain so there s no way he win t get his comeupance whether that s by die or go to jail we ll just have to see",
          "a very good read that show the realism in the nate jule story line I believe this rue jule nate story line be the primary drive force of euphoria s plot and I love it",

          "I ve be say for a while that I think rue will kill nate at the end of episode tonight s episode be make this more and more of a posibility the motive sem like it be there but from a storytele perspective the murder weapon hasn t be introduce yet in the previous six episode so the plausibility be low although the closing shot of rue loking at nate as well as the police car in the this be the pilot draft from the th of april two year before the show be release take from primetimer a website which alow aces to pilot script and pre release review be from january this year for those of y all who want the tl dr read the sentence at the end amp xb gt write by sam levinson draft date page count page gt gt script synopsis we be in the maternity ward of a new york hospital thre day after there be a bright fluorescent light the camera go down betwen the leg of a woman about to give birth right into her vagina and then inside her womb it s here that we met rue our heroine and narator a baby not yet ready to be tear from the comfort of her home she put up a fight but lose there she be blody and in the arm of her mother leslie on a tv set there be image of george w bush stand atop ground zero face the world say I can hear you the people who knock these building down will hear all of we soon people be chant usa usa usa a niple be shove into rue s mouth gt gt through a series of shot we be introduce to rue s childhod in a white suburban midle class neighborhod at year old a therapist diagnose she with attention deficit disorder obsesive compulsive disorder general anxiety disorder and posible bipolar disorder as a year old rue be chuby and so heavily medicate as to apear catatonic we see a montage of famous people include vincent van gogh sylvia plath fiona apple and britney spear remind we that those with mental disorder can stil achieve great thing cut to rue at as she snort fine powder she tell we about her tenage year the first dick pic she receive at the age of her first kis at the hand job and blow job some of which she be emotionaly coerce into gt gt now she be lay naked on the tile of the laundry room of a rando fuckboi s parent he be ask she if she come she say yes but she be clearly lie and she s clearly high then finally a moment of swetnes an old home video of she try to hula hop in the backyard with her father he be encourage her tell she not to give up back to today where she s clearly give up she introduce we to nate jacob the star qua terback of the fotbal team only to confes that he be find dead in a cornfield off route and that she be the one who kill he amp xb and yes I hear you say it this be a two year old pilot draft but if you look at everything besides the very opening sequence everything you read there be in the show so far just in a different order I ll say it again but it win t be the last time I think rue will go ahead and kill nate at the end of episode if not then some form of karma be go to catch up with he whilst he s at his least vulnerable let s have a discusion",
          "I have see a lot of theory that rue be dead and that be why she be narate or that jule may die I think there be a murder death and it s nate he be make a lot of enemy he get tyler lock away blackmail jule have madie in a toxic relationship must likely know about kat be a webcam girl also think he have something to do with the gay hazing of mckay because he use to date cadie it remind I of skin uk except this tony have no redeem quality what do you think",
          "yes I read it I be sorry I be closed minded to the idea of someone date an abusive blackmailer like the humanizing of nate be just to much he be ruin people s life and I will not even play around with the idea of he and jule be even remotely in play as a relationship",
          "I know people who have stay with someone like nate because they think he could be \" fix \" it only get ten time bad I can not condone any positive view about have a relationship with a toxic dangerous person like nate let they get well first and show you that they be well otherwise they will only bring you down with they",
          "no esentialy he be not he lie about everything he tell she he say he live with his mom only dad leave his family also nate be a sociopathic blackmailing abusive piece of shit like I say that scene be nate s face atach to tyler s word she love the idea of tyler while also hate nate",
          "rue will definitely relapse nate be either go to go to jail or die tyler s go to kill himself cassie s pregnant cal s secret will get out rue will do something to get back at nate rue and jule will end up just be friend maddy s go to turn on nate and confes fezco will get hurt or kill try to help rue rue will od again posibly on fentanyl",
          "what I would add to that be that the scene from the late episode after jule kis she in the pol rue say I just wish she d tell I about last night at this point of the story rue doesn t know that nate be blackmail jule so I would say that her naration of all the character and event be from the perspective of someone who know how the story end xb it s a bit like with memory when we look back on the memory from couple of year or month ago when we already know the consequence of our action it s easy to be wise or look at the event from a different perspective",
          "I think he shower because he be cover in tyler blood and he have a date with madie right after that to go bowling",
          "I could understand jule be blind to the toxicity and try to have a relationship with nate but for any viewer who have see everything we have all see to dream of a relationship betwen jule and nate at this point I have serious concern about their idea of healthy relationship or their thought on someone be ability to \" change \" there be no \" fix \" nate and I know that be the trap a lot of people fal into that cause they to stay in abusive toxic relationship",
          "totally agree the script be rarely dep and all the detail sem to be relevant nate can not be only the nasty boy sam levinson sem to expand I be the serie most of the topic touch I be asasination nation which be probably the reason why hbo chose he for the show",
          "yeah what cal say to maddy definitely aply to they as well",
          "I think cal know that nate have the tape of jule and he never say anything to his son because he feel like he have not the right because he feel guilty about all the thing he do and how because of he nate be how he be or maybe a part of cal think that nate maybe do not know about his secret but I do not think so",
          "lmao his brain be a labyrinth itself I think you hit it on the head his dad be definitely live through he the crepy thumb in mouth spech he give jule nod towards this he say he envys the youth and their oportunity in different crepy word and he tell jule she can either go and live her life outside the town or stay like he and live life in motel room I think he want to be with jule and like she a lot they be together though would destroy the perfection he try to convey to the world he definitely do not care for maddy he just have an obligation in his mind to be withand protect I be excited for the next episode",
          "I don t think it can because it look like selfie but since rue help they be a term like faux selfie profesional selfie so I doubt this can hurt rue lawfuly since jule would have to rat she out as well",
          "maddy kat and nate be pretty col",
          "maddy she s a cunt but her downfal will come later I let out a snort",
          "but about he watch his dad s video",
          "true but at the same time nate threaten she about the whole thing so I be sure she be stil shake up about it",

          "\" I think you be a fucking fagot just like your dad \"",
          "you talk like if maddy be an inocent angel who fal from the sky lmao she s far from that",
          "potentialy unpopular opinion I want nate to stick around on the show because he be such a fascinating character for the record I think he be a horible human being I just want to know more about what make he tick I be sure most of we would agree the short answer be privilege he be what happen in the darkest timeline of be a rich atractive straight white man except be he all those thing I find the topic of nate s sexuality on the show really interesting there be plenty of evidence to sugest he be gay be on the gay date app in the first place his obsesion with dick avoid they in the locker room ask maddy about tyler s dick size etc that say there be enough plausible deniability that he could be a pure sociopath and all these thing be plan but I think the show be try to say that some of these behavior be learn and not inate which lead I back to his sexuality whether it be actually true or not the character gosip about nate be gay and to an extent nate s aware of this jule say so to his face and this be the interesting part nate posibly be gay be the only time the character make a big deal about someone be lgbtq most of the main character be sexualy fluid I think it be a great thing really we do not belabor the fact that rue be date a girl or that jule be tran that be so refreshing but for nate the character stil gosip about his sexuality and I think that play into his mis conception of masculinity that be it be shameful to be male and quer or even perceive as quer to nate it be a weaknes and it exacerbate his sociopathic personality sorry for the long think piece y take on a character that be not exactly a fan favorite and maybe this be obvious to you all already but I would love to get your take what be your read on nate s sexuality would he be gay make he more interesting do any of this even matter",
          "well one of the brother be aron lol",
          "maddy identify tyler at the station at the end of the episode sure nate s manipulate she but she should definitely know well than to frame an inocent person especially because she be the one who get tyler in this mess in the first place",
          "I think nate s blackmailing jule because he know his dad fuck she and do not want she to ruin his life and I think that rue kising jule be real but now that you mention it it could be a fantasy however they do already kis and jule do not make a big deal about it so maybe they do kis also since she come back from her date with tyler aka nate maybe she want to be comfort and kis by rue",
          "I didn t want to make different post so I think I d just post it all here k so maybe I m reach but I be rewatche the trailer for the season try to pick out cap that we haven t see yet there be a after the carnival that all the kid be at amp xb what I m get at be if jule be to get hurt by nate or maddy or someone in their circle I don t see they all go to the dance together I could see nate emotionaly hurt jule by show up and be like don t believe everyone you hok up with online or something but I don t see he physicaly harm her maybe he even get cold foot about met she but he could just walk away or it could be his dad who folow jule since we see edit the shadow be really tall it s nate nevermind but stil amp xb here be some cap from the trailer that sem interesting to I and could spark some discusion from ep rue hold her jule someone she met in maybe jule go back to met her old friend from before she move amp xb met at a motel and more comfort amp xb some people have speculate nate be be asault some have even speculate that it s by his father I could see it be by fez maybe give nate a taste of his own medicine or tyler come back and get revenge someone post last week about nate getting murder in a script somewhere who know that someone amp xb copy and paste from a different comment I write cassie colapse onto the flor stal there be another one where she and mckay be at a fod stand and she say I feel like to mckay be as he cry and there be a shot of cassie look up at someone in the I be gues maybe she will find out she be pregnant and he will dump she once he she will get an abortion as a result maybe without tell he bonus cassie and mckay at the amp xb feel free to speculate and tear this post to piece I just couldn t slep and tonight episode make I pump",
          "I feel like the scene be more about she realize she do not have feeling for nate and do have those feeling for rue but why no change she texte rue right after almost and sem really upset laying in bed definitely to I it sem like she realize she have more feeling for woman but to each their own",

          "I also find that whole sequence to be out of character with rue asking fez to threaten nate give her previous ability to handle problem herself I think there be a couple posibility a rue admit she find nate scary before and be intimidate by he b she didn t think anything she could do or say would be enough to disuade nate c perhaps she didn t want to directly confront nate and anger jule in the proces d while she may have be wiling to confront nate from her perspective the sure win method would be to have gangsta fez do it for she they could have explain her reasoning well because as a d have point out it leave a lot to interpretation and question about her character",

          "yeah I definitely think nate will have to die by the end of the season because he be by far the most unlikable character on the show I think at most everyone can see where the rot of his problem be but I doubt anyone watch the show like he as a person or suport he because of be the least like on the show how a lot of the subplot link back to he and the fact that he s very iredemable I feel like there s no choice but to kill he off it sort of remind I of the season finale of big little lie to spoiler because by the end pery be so unlikable and iredemable that it have to happen",
          "maybe I m reach but rue bring her lil fidgety ass over there talk about have fez scare nate with a gun but she make it sem like nate be fucking with her aswel as jule I don t think nate have any bef with rue they never even speak so she kind of lie about nate fuck with she because I don t think fez would step up for jule if he didn t think rue be a target fez be col with jule but not that col",
          "nate be sexualy insecure but he isn t gay he be in the gay app to bait jule he see the video his father make with she and freak out that the girl he threaten and buly at a party have a huge secret about his family that could ruin his way of life so he decide to manipulate she and extort her the dick pick he have in his phone be random one he use to send jule likely of guy over to avoid the same crime jule comit",
          "I m not point any finger at all here but we really know next to nothing about nate s old brother other than that s jailbait bruh comment about jule make during the carnivalhe sem like he might be half in the bag at the carnivalso if this theory turn out to be corect I might his brother have something to do with it",
          "prediction rue die nate and jule somehow go to end together on s or in the case that rue do not die maybe they will end up together in s but I do not think so the skype guy be go to haras kat maybe threaten she with her nude maybe nate s go to jail but I do not think so mckay go to lose his shit maybe he will brake up with cassie because he feel really pres with all the thing about fotbal maybe maddy leave nate and this time for real maybe she find out about the thing with jule sorry if my english be bad",
          "I do not think so because this show could kep go and I kind of hope it do that limit it severely and lead to predictable ending as after episode you re already predict it you could be right who know crepy nate dad s voice but selfishly I hope your wrong",
          "in episode rue explain about nate s father and his porn habit the fact that it have not yet come out to the character in the show mean most of this will have to be expose at some point to I this be the big hint that it be all about to hit the fan and eventualy come out",
          "and yes I agree I just get triger by some nate fan who be a bit weird because I have see abuse first hand and yes I know it be a tv show and it be so good I just do not like the weird obsesion over nate",
          "with season one come to an end this sunday I m curious to hear what your prediction for the finale be here s mine kat s cam stunt be about to blow up in her face because black scren guy she be chat with be ominous as shit rule be go to come to a mesy end hopefuly they can stil be friend because I personally like they well like that anyway lexi be gay either nate be go to get away with everything really hope that doesn t happen or madie be go to see the light and stop enable he to be a piece of shit not really hold my breath on that one rue might relapse I really hope not because I m rot for her someone s go to die",
          "right now I be at the stage where I be try to get the timeline right in my different theory scenario it be a mess lol but I really really hope I be completely wrong about this and no one or just nate he can go die at all also very glad tomorow be sunday and I can get more info to overanalyze",
          "I think find a ton of video of your maried dad bang a bunch of young gay man and young tran woman at a young age qualifie as sexual trauma involve man on its own",
          "same which be why I consider this one of my big oh shit moment he s that physicaly intimidate serious respected man around town with a secret that we ve see dozen of time in medium and as soon as we see he be nate s dad my imediate asumption be that cal would end up be a physicaly verbaly abusive father and that would explain nate be so fuck up and violent it s a refreshing angle",
          "sorry I be be hyperbolic what I mean be that when they have almost every relationship in the show have some sort of infidelity as a direct result of stres it get whack because it turn into cheat be actually okay normal as a reaction to stres it work when it s only specific character do it because then it s a part of their character it work in nate and madie s relationship because it show how they ve get an unhealthy relationship and that s one of the aspect of it however when every fucking time there s conflict in someone s life they basically just go and fuck the near person who isn t their partner in the show it turn into a trope it take away the power from one person specificaly do it because it go from this person cheat because they get their self worth from the attention of man because their relationship be extremely unhealthy and they don t respect their partner as much as they feel lock in to their partner to this person cheat because this be the show where the writer don t know how to show self destructive behavior except through sex and then the message it send outside of just be por form when write a show be that cheating be normal behavior to deal with stres because of how realistic the show be they do not really have the excuse of well it s just entertainment because they re intentionaly make it a realistic mas market drama they show it as bad but fight club also show the whole fight club movement as bad and they stil get a generation of bored something be to think that start an anarchist movement build around not get your dick wet enough be col as shit",
          "this except i d switch kat with nate on the second list",
          "totally agree about the bait jule and dick pic but why be he on the app in the first place I could be answer my own question here if nate know his father use the app to I stil think there be other hint of he hide any aspect of himself that be not hyper masculine and if he be gay that would be he deny something that be actually true but if he be not it be clear he do not even want to be think of as even posibly be gay and the people gosip about it they make a big deal about it so I gues my big question be what be the show say about how we talk about guy even posibly be gay",
          "I m stake my power of observation and experience with abuse myself on this nate be abuse I ve see what sex addiction do when kid find porn early and typicaly it go hand in hand with experiment re enact what they ve see I could absolutely understand he hate his dad because of the video alone and his own nate s unwanted penchant for view the vid but the writer might be telegraph very loudly that something happen to nate around mom ask he flat out doesn t it sem nate avoid the question lie my cent I want to be wrong but sein dad s porn in my mind isn t enough to explain all of nate s dysfunction",
          "I get the impresion that she have be take \" typical \" nude shot of herself and send they from school we learn later and that be why she ask rue to take \" clasy nude \" of she to look well",
          "you re right about nate s obsesion with jule another prof of this that you leave out be that in episode rue say that during nate s indefinite suspension he would check in on maddy and check in on jule but most importantly he would watch jule house at night which I think be super weird but what I really want to know be where this obsesion lead to and the thing you say about he trust jule before the chili stand confrontation be also right because I also have the same question of what if jule didn t confront cal at the chili stand would thing have go diferently because clearly it be the confrontation that make he snap you could see the disapointment and angst in his face when jule leave he trust jule he think jule be threaten his dad not know that she have no bad intention and she just want to prove to rue that she inded slep with cal that explain why nate kis jule before he start to blackmail her he definitely have something for her but he just have to put all that behind to protect his family he s stil a psycho thoand no one really know why he have a bunch of dick on his phone",
          "yea I think so to as he would have issue but the level of anger he have his father be pretty clearly molest he that plus the fact that there be a mis kid from the family photo and the other brother be pretty mesed up to point to classic sign of abuse",
          "I think nate go to kill jule",
          "I think nate be go to pul out a knife and fucking stab jule dude",
          "usualy the one that sem the strong be struggle the most maybe lexi botle s it up like mckay but have well emotional inteligence maybe lexi will snap and she will kill nate",
          "yeah I m a sucker for a good female female love story in the pilot episode when rue say she d stil fuck nate I be a little disapointed because I think they be use the trailer to mislead we all into think there be go to be something betwen she and jule but at least they didn t completely trick we her crush be real it s just heavy and more complicated because of all the other element suround it",
          "I m totally with you that it be a bad rash decision but on the other hand I think fez really do care about rue like a sister and no matter what state of mind she s in something nate have do have she so fuck up she s talk gun I think he s take the oportunity to be protective of she regardles of what the circumstance be and nate be not a pushover so he amp it up from some minor intimidation to a death threat smart logical or reasonable no understandable yeah I can see why he make that jump",
          "seriously if \" tyler \" die cuz he fuck jule up I be glad",
          "luke need to go fuck himself",
          "in other news they have my girl lexi off the juice and the banyan at least kat get a happy ending come around to madys character cassie actually get the abortion mckay be ghost its halfway fuck jule because I stil have a soft spot for her nate stil be not shit jule dad be the most oblivious parent in the world cal do something notable for once fez have murder on his mind that rue sequence please explain and for the people in the back fuck ana tyler stil lock up but you know he probably should be that be the season finale with roughly no context",
          "to be fair she be be a wreck since nate fuck with her she be probably desperate to escape and run away and unfortunately rue got tangle up in it as an emotional casualty",
          "another week another crisis avert now I be not condone cheat my heart be on the brink of explosion when mckay get close to the dor I be go to he secretly know she be back there otherwise why check the room but lexi save cassie and rue that night even after they clown she for her bob ros costume",
          "first of all english be not my first language so sorry if I say something wrong sorry if I have gramatical eror okayi be fascinating with nate and I refuse to the idea that he be only a psycho one dimensional character and I believe that be more behind the blackmail this be my theory okay jule slep with cal one week before school start it be sumer and in the same night of mckay s party she met nate in that party right one week later they start school and we can see that jule be not talk to \" tyler \" yet I do not know how be in we but I be gues school start at the end of sumer and begining of autumn and we never know in what month they be in the show we can only gues by the weather okay so when we finally see jule chat with \" tyler \" I see more kid in the school with jacket and long sleve and pant so I be gues that be be autumn spring so if I be right in this nate have wait at least two week or even a month to talk to jule it would be weird if he wait that long to start talk to she if he want from the begining to threaten she because he be scared that she could try to do something to his family ' because we can predict that nate go very often to his dad s ofice and it be obvious he see his tape with jule okay let we continue \" tyler \" send dick pic we see jule say to rue \" look his dick be huge blah blah blah \" and rue say that she do not know because be float in space okay there be no way nate would know that jule would ask for another pic compare to something to know if it be big or not let we say that she ask he for another pic next to something to know the size how nate would find the same person with the same dick with a botle I mean it can happen yes it have to be I do not know some pornstar dick what I be try to say nate feel atract to jule that be why he start talk to her he be obses with she some people say that he be in love with she but I do not think so he send his dick pic why I be say this because obviously he could not put his abdomen pic in the profile because she see his abdoman at the party but his ego be huge so if he have a nice penis he would want to show her jule nude we can compare cassie with jule in this when mckay ask cassie for her nude she do not feel comfortable and at the begining she refuse that can happen to anybody who have a bad experience like she or that be shy and in the other hand we can see that jule really want to take nude for \" tyler \" she take a lot even in the school bathrom and ask rue to help she what this say to we two thing nate do ask she for her nude or he do not ask she I would say that he do but he actually send she his pic to it be not like with mckay another thing I do not know what be wrong with nate but he do not give a fuck if someone find out his chat with jule he even talk with she in the cafeteria when he be with maddy and when he go to the shower and leave his phone and maddy find out the dick pic I do not know why he be like that someone can explain we all know that nate barely smile but when he be talk to jule he be all soft and smile sometimes like if I be try to blackmail someone I would not be all smiley and \" happy \" the dick pic we can see a lot of dick pic in nate s phone right okay if he be blackmail jule with photo of a white man why he have all type of color and size of penis in his phone I hear a theory that say he do this with all the man and woman he be dad slep with okay so how he be go to find all these people and how be he be go to blackmail those who be adult he can say he be go to kill they but then why pretend he be someone who want to fuck they first in the app what be my theory be simple he want to know how to take a good dick pic the photo with the evian botle be his that be why maddy look at that one otherwise why she would look at that one if we all know the point before maybe I be wrong with this one to be honest I be not completely sure let we continue nate fal \" in love \" with jule he actually like her and I do not think he be very happy about it so what I believe be that he do all the thing in the app to prove she that be he can be a good guy we all know this be not true but he do it because he be obses with her when in the carnival jule go to the chili stand and show rue be true that she slep with cal that be the thing that fuck up nate why he trust her he really want to met she by the lake because he think he be in love with she a brief comparison of maddy and jule before I continue when maddy say \" you be the swet guy ever \" she be say that to the violent protective nate the character I think he always try to be and he believe he have to be when he talk with jule she say \" you be so swet \" to the nate that be open and soft and actually swet that be why he say \" I feel like no one irl would ever call I swet \" because it be true no one know that part of nate okay so when jule leave the chili stand and aron ask who be her nate face omg he look to the ground and I feel like he be in \" pain \" it be the look of someone who fels betray what be I say this he feel like I say betray or vulnerable like he can not trust her like he would never expect she do something like that you may think it be not a big deal well even his dad feel threaten when they met at the lake I believe he be test her if he can trust she or no that be why he start say that he be not the person she met at the party blah blah and when she say \" can you let go off I \" he be hand be shake when he aproach she he say that he fal aslep to she and blah blah and she say she do not trust he and of course he do not trust she either look if he really hate she or whatever why would he kis her if he say the thing he say but do not kis she I would understand that he do not like she but he do to this moment she reject he thre time when she walk away from he when she ask he to let go off she and when she say she do not trust he okay so why nate would say nice thing to she and kis she if he do not like she and even when he be blackmail she he be say that be she be smart she have a big heart that be he be generous and when nate blackmail she I be really confused because she never show sign that she could want to ruin nate s family but then I realize that she actually do when she go to the chili stand what I be try to say the thing about that he link she to child pornography be a lie he probably make that up moment before when he see she in the chili stand he tough she be not trustworthy we all know that she do not like what she do that it be only to show rue that be she be not lie but nate do not know that so what I be scared of be that something can happen with jule and nate I be go to be honest ' til episode I think the only one obses be nathaniel I think jule already forget he like it pas a couple of month because be halowen but in the party when in her halucination she see nate I be like wtf I know love do not fade away just like that but he do a lot of shit he blackmail she and he make she give a false testimony and she stil in love I want to say a last thing I kind of understand maddy and jule I never be in a abusive relationship but I once be in love with a boy who do some fuck up thing to I and I be stil in love with he and a part of I want he to change for I that be what I believe jule feel she want he to come back crawl and say sorry that he be tyler and he love she that be all that it will take to jule to forgive he and she want to have power over he I believe that jule have feeling for rue rue be good for her but we never want what be easy what love we it be not always like that but it would be realistic I really hope jule do not end up with nate because he can \" love she \" but he be really dangerous and he have some fuck up issue maybe I be look to dep in this situation but I do not know please tell I what you think",
          "ah my bad be tired when I read your original post I agree I gues all we can do be hope there s a big pay off at the end for the whole nate thing",
          "after rue take the nude the next scene show jule put her bra back on and rue peaking over so yes they just do not show it on scren",
          "I don t think rue be go to kill nate but I do think that by the end of the season he s go to get some karma for what he s do",
          "what about cal be there suicide",
          "his name on the app be tyler so I really think he know exactly what he be do from the start he s so machiavelian",
          "I agree I personally think nate s character be bisexual and be try to repres both his same sex atraction and his atraction to trans woman he be create these \" rule \" for who he be alow to be atract to in order to kep those side of himself repres he be deply disturb when jule met all of the specification that he create yet she be stil tran",
          "all I know be someone be getting shot next episode",
          "oh no be there real people out there ship these nate s own dad be woried about he and that dude have a vast colection of self involve porn range from barely legal to not legal",
          "first rue bait the na counselor and get he to back date her atendance recordnext kat threaten to bring child porn charge against anyone share she videofinaly nate make tyler admit to rape madyintereste way to weaponize a potential vulnerability just something I notice this week while watch",
          "ok so why exactly do nate need to blackmail jule also do rue and jule actually kis or be rue just fantasize my brain can not tale this",
          "everyone except nate s brother",
          "I be think about this early tonight do we think there be go to be a clifhanger end to the season if so what do we think it be go to be super curious to hear what people think personally I think rue will od close to the end of the last episode amp we will be leave wonder if she be go to live or die I have not give much thought to the other character so I would be super interested to hear what you all think",
          "I have be think about this to nate feel so different in that scene episode I do not know how to describe it but more like a lighthearte ashole I think he would be the typical jock type that be always make disgusting joke and show off for his boy like bryce in reason why but instead he be just a brod psycho so I gues that be a refreshing change of pace lol",
          "it s that rue say she kill he because she push fezco to threaten he and he kill he after nate call the cop for fezco threaten he I think it s his dad beat he up though so maybe his dad do for he snop and know his secret",
          "I don t have any expectation whatever I think be go to happen probably win t I m just go to be pis that this be the last episode of the season and the next season win t be out until late",
          "so do anyone think jule show full on nudity in the picture from the school bathrom I be rewatche nate s spech to she and I realize that he say she would be put on the sex ofender registry because she take nude in the school bathrom the picture that rue take of she be only half nude so I be just wonder what she show nate tyler",
          "the kat and ethan storyline resolve itself and they get together cassie get an abortion nothing else be really resolve though",
          "or plot twist but very much unlikely everything work out fine with jule and nate and that pis off rue and shater her world even more which eventualy lead to rue kiling nate so she can be with her or just hate jule for she be right about he and go into a downward spiral of depresion lead to she have another od but this time she do not survive",
          "it do not explain at all why he be so agresive and hate the fuck out of his dad",
          "you nate and jule shiper be weird how could she posibly have feeling for he he be blackmail her she have feeling for tyler the person he be pretend to be he just about lie about everything he tell she when he be tyler so she obviously do not have feeling for nate she love rue and care for she deply so uh yeah there be more than just friend feeling for both of they if you have be in an abusive relationship then you know an abuser do not really have feeling for the person they abuse they love to control they nate be a sociopath he be obses with the idea of control jule and hurt and control madi this man need to be kill and or put in prison",
          "now I know you be tell lie that manequin be not maddy it be not even when they be shot",
          "deadas I think cal be go to fucking nuke her I be like \" run bitch \"",
          "eh I cut nate a tiny bit of slack nate s dad be cal for god sake do you see how his dad rip into that kid for not be as dedicate to fotbal as he think he should be imagine that dude have the great input into your development as a human and not come out fuck up I mean yeah nate s choice be his own but I think that in a different family nate wouldn t be so nate",
          "so I know there s be non stop theory and speculation on nate jule and rue and basically what the hell be go on what may happen I personally be on the I don t think nate want to hurt jule I think he legitimately want her and here be some hint I think back it up in ep all of the encounter nate have with jule she pretty much fulfil his female checklist of thing he like ex tenis skirt long neck thigh gap etc in the scene where jule slice her arm mckay party I think it be interesting how nate would yel about no one know jule and yel about how he s go to fuck she up but very quietly and carefuly whisper to she that he know what she be and that he ll give her attention when rue s explain nate and maddy s relationship their prefered sex position be legit an exact replica of how his dad be with jule and all of the partner in the video he see dogy position physicaly push their face down into the pilow bed nate s dad like to look down on his motel partner of choice and do the weird thumb thingy which be the same way the scene betwen nate and maddy discus her virginity be shot nate look down on maddy and basically be their relationship overal because of their drastic height diference rue say maddy can be a bitch like that night at mckay party something in he snap etc and at first you think it s anger but then they show nate stumble into his house walk up the stair to look his dad s colection I think something in he snap might be his realization that he prefer girl like jule and not maddy which be the angry jock borderline sociopath that he s project make he angry and I think he beat up tyler be more about that anger and release it rather than actually think that he rape maddy also notice how he tell tyler to get on his kne before he beat the shit out of he c and then shower like how his dad do in the motel room with jule amp xb rue statement of I ve never met anyone like jule before I feel like rue and nate share that same feeling also she know alot about nate s life but doesn t know what happen betwen jule parent which I find interesting amp xb also when cal be message jule on the app he say how perfect and beautiful she be ergo I be pretty sure her pic be on the site ergo nate know its she but obvs doesn t want it to blow up in his face be the quarterback and such maybe rue s it get weird statement be cal catch nate and jule hang out or something amp xb ok I be do sorry for the word vomit just try to pas the time until the next episode",
          "wait be nate and tyler different people",
          "but would rue get in trouble for it nate doesn t know that she help she take the picture",
          "also I don t understand why she couldn t have met tyler in public I couldn t have tell that she be tran and I think nobody would just be suspicious of that",
          "fezco go to nate s house to colect his money probably tell he that mouse will kill they if they do not which cal give to he cal confront nate about how all of his bulshit have ruin the family and cost they a ton of money masterade have to be someone that kat know because why would they alter their voice and hide their face I do not think it be ethan or cal like a lot of other people on here sem to think maybe one of the twin cassie get an abortion and she and mckay break up I do not think nate die my bet be on maddy cal or fezco rue relapse and have another near death experience",
          "I do not know about nate be col but I would say he be a pretty interesting character",
          "I think nate be sexualy abuse by cal there be hint to it in episode when cal go into nate room in the scene after nate see the tape cal have hide there be uneasy vibe like nate be use to cal come into his room and manipulate he then nate s like and dislike be describe and he obviously have an extreme aversion to male sexuality like he have be traumatize then there be nate s agresion and the way he call tyler a \" fagot \" when he be physicaly asault he and acuse he of rape maddy there be also a strange dynamic in the jacob family like there be a secret the whole family be complicit in keping and I do not think it be just the secret of cal be gay because nate sem so angry at his family as if they do not protect he male victim of sexual asault also feel an imense amount of shame so I think nate be try to kep his family shit under wrap because he do not want everyone to find out what his dad do to he finally the way he abuse maddy and jule be like he be copy something he have see or experience",
          "I think she ll be take as colateral by mouse or murder by nate we see already nate can t control his anger and rue threaten his livelihod",
          "nate blackmailing jule rather than beat the shit out of or rape she like I be expect mckay getting rape by frat boy I don t think I blink that whole scene rue s breakdown at fez s dor that one have I sob",
          "rue statement of I ve never met anyone like jule before I feel like rue and nate share that same feeling also she know alot about nate s life but doesn t know what happen betwen jule parent which I find interesting jule just move to town rue have know nate since at least midle school it s not that weird to know more about nate than she do jule be that they just met",
          "this be one I believe the most people also say that she be also stres because of nate threat",
          "there be no evidence to sugest that nate know about kat at all and there be no way he be responsible for mckay s haze that be just what frat do",
          "do anyone think that nate project his angry feeling towards his dad onto tyler I think it be out of place for nate to call tyler a \" f got \" but maybe he be lash out at he because he be disgust with his dad action",
          "well hunter say in an interview that jule be quer I think nate really do a number on she because she really do fal fast and hard for tyler so she be probably have some trust issue in that area along with the fact that nate be stil extort she and she s in a stresful situation so be rue s addiction and her lifeline right now just isn t easy it sem like it s move to fast for she at the moment",
          "to point number one I think nate have create this list of atribute of his \" ideal \" woman as a reaction formation against his atraction to the man and trans woman he have see in his dad s video he be create this schema of what a woman he be atract to \" should \" be with every typicaly \" feminine \" quality imaginable tenis skirt fresh pedicure no body hair slend shoulder long leg thigh gap feminine voice feminine body language because be with the ideal feminize woman will \" prove \" to he that he be not atract to man or to trans woman then when jule come along and actually tick all of these box as a trans woman his atraction to her awaken his internalized homophobia transphobia and subsequent fear rage self hatred his atraction to even the most \" feminine \" of woman be no long safe to he and he snap",
          "that be maddy",
          "I see quite a few people say that nate s description of what he look for in a girl heavily match jule however hunter do an interview that she be happy to see a trans woman in a quer relationship so what be you thought",
          "I didn t catch on until the thing where she be talk to tyler about they met on a gay date app which be how I asume nate s dad met her I be like why would jule be try to hok up with gay dude oh",
          "I think her interaction with nate have be so nonexistent it ll be like arya kill the nk",
          "I think a lot of people have hear by now that the pilot script originaly have rue reveal she kill nate I do wonder if they change their mind or if they re save that reveal for the finale xb one line that get I think be what rue say in episode one she go I never have much of an issue with nate until all the bulshit with jule when I first watch the episode I think she be adres the kitchen fight and didn t think much of it but now that this upcoming episode be hint at nate come up with a plan yeah it s very posible that he ll fuck with jule somehow and rue will hate he for it and maybe do something about it",
          "in the promo of euphoria we can see maddy and jule dance together so maybe I be wrong or maddy do it just to pis nate",
          "I think nate threaten she or hit her and cal overhear there be a clip in the promo and maddy be a mess perhaps lead to a beat down where he have nate pin on the ground",
          "in the original pilot script rue say she murder nate",
          "it look like it be center around kat and her background came but we will for sure get more rue and jule and most likely some nate stuff I just want to start a discusion to see what everyone think be come this week",
          "I may have misunderstod it but I think that nate have take tyler s phone maybe so he could not call or maybe because he think tyler would die and want to kep up apearance on his social medium acount that he be okay and tyler be actually shyguy but I be tired and do not pay much attention to the phone I will rewatch again tomorow",
          "I think you make good point and I agree with you I also think that nate be curious to see what his dad like about have sex with tran girl or young gay man he want to understand his dad and what he enjoy about it his dad have be hide this and project this white midle american I do not know dream or reality when that s not the case at all I think he want to understand his dad more be I make any sense",
          "great idea and honestly it be hard to folow for anyone I think a lot go on in those flash I just want to add that while jule be make out with nate she dominate he by gag he with her finger and tell he that he s a pusy and a bitch and she wish the whole world could know it definitely wasn t the dreamy oh but I secretly have a crush on he fantasy situation that I be woried it be go to turn into when he apear and tell she she have texte he",

          "doesn t remind I of tony at all tony be a dick head but he at least care about his friend and I don t see how nate could get the university jock to do anything doesn t sem like he d know they at all and why would they do anything he say in the first place",
          "do anyone else feel like rue be go to be the one to take nate down the cinematography at the party this episode hint at it along with how nate have nothing on she to manipulate and threaten she with jule could also do it but she would have to go for cal as an \" if I be go down I be take you with I \" sort of thing",
          "rue take a gun from fez to kill nate ethan be the weirdo that kat skype maddy die jule tell rue about nate which be why she try to kill he cal go to jail or fight nate kat have her nude leak or gets out to her per cassie have the abortion but something happen with she and mckay fez well not go to jail I know that much",

          "well she be in a hospital but it sem like she get out because she talk to nate outside the school stil posible I gues",
          "there be no main character of each episode even when it be nate s episode we do not get much or as much as I expect",
          "oh damn you and op make a really good point I just make a post on how sociopathic he sem but I think this part of the story be really important to I also really do not like nate but I now realize he may say a lot more than what one may initialy think of he maybe nate be not redemable but maybe someone irl feel the need to be as violent just from what they be teach and what people s expectation be of they",
          "be you nate",
          "I be gag over the th episode my heart be beat so freak fast the last minute jesus I be almost have a heart issue I be cry no I be sob I hate nate first off all idgf about his little boy issue because he be a fcking cunt gia smoking wed my jaw drop but like I can not I just can not get over the rewind of jule and rue s memory and the kis fck I need more episode how be I suppose to wait for real I know that the relationship they may create be go to end up real bad but you know what I be live the moment the moment that they love each other and need each other in order to survive I be aware that jule be go probably to hurt rue because yeah you know what I mean I be not sure they love each other in the same way",
          "she fuck up for sure but nate coerce she into it he threaten to ruin jule ' life so what would he do to madiehe already choke she",
          "she do not know that be what nate s do he probably lie to her nate s a manipulative prick",
          "I really don t think he will I think nate s dad comit suicide be go to happen",
          "I swear if nate end up kill rue in the finale which I be very scared for I will only watch season to see he get what he deserve I love jule but rue be my favorite and since I have hear the theory about she die I have be very scared",
          "hm I never really notice any of that stuff but rember the dude in cal s hotel in ep he s in the porn video that cal make I think so rue narative have to come into play eventualy",
          "it be weird because nate show both psychopathic and sociopathic tendency sociopath tend to be more impulsive violent and be product of their upbringe environment but they be capable of empathy guilt and build meaningful relationship with other psychopath be calculate sometimes but not always violent and it be consider to be more of an inherit personality disorder they be extremely good at fake emotion to fit in with other but do not actually feel guilt or remorse for their action we have not see much of cal so far but he sem to be just as manipulative and control as nate minus the physical violence part",
          "I think that those be all great posibility I also think that rue realize that by she go to nate directly it could actually put jule life in danger I e he would just be so angry that he would asault jule",
          "what would you do if either rue or jule end up die this season I personally would become depresed asf",
          "and and and when jule pule the knife on nate at the party she scare the shit out of he ie exactly what nate s dad warn about the blade get sharp the close they be she force herself into nate s psyche by force he to acknowledge in a public seting that he be afraid of both the knife and her own boldnes",
          "yeah the demonization of cal as a psycho pedo rapist by some of the show s fan be already concern enough consider all he be be a closeted gay bisexual man id hope the show would not add more fuel to the fire by legitimize those kind of take by show he comit some kind of incestual act on a young nate",
          "I m go to be honest and say that I do not think cal be a bad guy I think he struggle with his sexuality and be scared to come out because of his position in the comunity I definitely do not condone he cheat on his wife or some of the other questionable shit he do but I think he be just scared all of the time",
          "even if jule date nate she would stil be in a quer relationship",
          "aron be the old child nate be the midle child ashtray be give up as a literal baby under a year old and the young boy in the image of the jacob s family be at least fezco be in his s several year old than nate neither of these theory be plausible",
          "I think the rejection angle be pretty likely I can even imagine nate s sociopathic ass get she set up by get her nude leak indirectly",
          "I know nate would be a gemini smh",
          "omg yeah which will either give nate a rain check and he will realize that all the fucked up shit he s do be not okay or it will fuel his rage even more and he ll be act even more batshit crazy ack",
          "all of this be why I think nate be the most interesting character in the show so far something I definitely didn t expect i think he would be the typical crush ber can against head bro but it be refreshing to see a jock character coly calculate a take down rather than just punch tyler the first chance he get add to the fact that his father be a fucked up presence in his life make he a lot more complex than I think he would be",
          "I be wonder this as well although I be stil try to figure out if people on that app can see each other s face or not in other word be nate cat fishing jule to cause harm or do they both just click with each other through the app because they honestly like each other from the image they each curently have up on the app",
          "hm I read that and it s be on the back of my mind however since nate be mention in the episode description up til episode I don t think he do die as the twist end for episode though he could stil be part of the story in flashback if it do happen to I it sem like that idea of he die be either scrap or postpone until the finale I m also get really into this show so good",
          "jule also never see nate wear those clothe and make up but she stil picture he like that it s just a halucination",
          "I m sure someone will die and it win t be a murder lexi cassie nate rue s sister maybe not I can def see a suicide happen",
          "she want to scare nate and fez say that be stupid he try to have a chil conversation with nate but when that wasn t posible he threaten his life that be his choice his action not rue s fault at all she didn t force he to do anything in fact she be easily talk out of her idea because fez think it be stupid",
          "I feel like it be definitely to early to call as euphoria go on we could find out any of those thre character be dead die I do not know if nate be go to be the vilain of this series or if he be go to through some major character development but I kind of definitely feel that sociopath vibe from he I feel like rue s infatuation and addiction will make whatever relationship they have rocky and short live I also really like rue and fez though I know there be like a chance that actually happen so I might be a little biased I personally think rue and jule and jule and nate look like it could be nothing but unhealthy at the moment jule should be with someone stable so maybe a third option introduce later in the series",
          "I see a pic that jule kis someone but that guy do not look like nate hope she can end up with rue they be so swet and cute",
          "I m think rue will end up kill nate to protect or avenge jule like jule be hurt not dead rue saw fez s gun tuck into the couch and fez have interact with rue since her outburst against he and see she sober up for her new drug jule so I m think rue will take the gun as the situation heat up with nate under the guise of just hang out with fez who win t mind let she in his home due to feel rue be addict to jule and not drug anymore then fez be implicate in the kiling of nate since it be his gun but rue will turn herself in and the voiceover she provide be her recount to the police the event that lead up to her kill nate",
          "I think it go back to the whole he project himself into tyler during the beat down the whole call he a f get that I think he be really beat himself up and j just think he be continue with that sort of metaphor",
          "yeah rue say nate and his family be scary then joke about get money from they that s when jule snap because clearly it s not a joking matter to she because she s terified but rue doesn t know it yet",
          "I ve literally never see a single post encourage nate jule or nate maddy",
          "rue get depresed and watch straight episode of a british reality show jule go to visit an old friend cassie look for advice in the aftermath of halowen night",
          "wait I do not get it the guy do not even know she be friend with maddy and cassie",
          "also not to mention the way cal talk to that one guy in the motel about hide his sexuality and if he think it afect his kid even if they do not know about it I think that could be use to reference nate and how its afect he and his sexuality because he s a direct image of his dad even to the point of kep it hide know his dad do not even acept himself he be secretly homophobic towards his dad and therefore have issue acept himself as well",
          "I really believe sam be give rue his recovery story get clean at so I don t believe she ll die but the mercutio fez ad tybalt nate paralel sound dope I d like to see it",
          "where jule cut herself to throw off nate s beat down intention I be like \" that be one bad bitch right there \" and I be hok",
          "I be actually curious about the backstory behind rue and nate in the first episode it sem like they be somewhat friend she be like \" he try to finger I on the dance flor \" or something like that which be super weird lmao and then he make that \" I would do it for rue \" comment yet that be the only time they ever talk during the entire season so far I do not know I wish they would go more in depth into their friendship because it sem interesting to I lmao",
          "yeah they need to show some more dimension with nate because this be just get stupid",
          "she basically snap after rue say nate be scary and joke about get money from his family I think she s scared of freak rue out by tell she that her life be basically on his hand right now she know it would afect rue which only add to the presure of be the one that kep she clean",
          "you re right I forget that he spy on jule at night which be super weird why be he so obses with her he have she threaten and control what be the need to watch on she at night yes the expresion of disapointment in his face after jule leave the stand be shocking I believe he have his priority and family come first and he think he can not trust jule",
          "it be not for everyone be cup of tea I admit I be a low key jule nate shiper but I stan for hunter jacob hahaha just because we ship this do not mean we be total idiot to not condone this abusive relationship in real life okay irl have not you see or encounter couple who be in an abusive relationship and wonder why be they stil together no at least empathize if you be in those shoe of the abused depres lonely please empathize not only the victim but at least try to understand nate s side I believe or at least I like to believe that nate be redemable why because he be human we be just human for christ s sake I be not say he must not be punish he need to go to prison lmao and help from psychiatrist or whatever the main reason why I love this show it be because it be totally humanize real the addiction depresion of this show do not only relate to teen but to everyone tenager young adult adult etc so can we just shut this up and enjoy the show it be already the finale episode next week revel in it",
          "nate doesn t die in episode he s list in the episode description for and",
          "yeah maybe it be obvious that cal be already pretty sus about nate consider he straight up say to nate s face that he do not think nate deserve to get out of the situation with the cop",
          "snap as in do something rash to nate",
          "there be woman who actively want to fuck serial kiler why be you surprised people ship nate and jule",
          "bitch what the fuck motherfucker what the fuck just happen motherfucker rue relasped and we get a new song by zen and then oh fucking then jule leave without rue and they admit their love for each other and cassie get an abortion and fez do he shot the doctor and why do nate get a happy ending he s evil and kat oh my fuck she find true love but it be not go to last and madie find the tape and nate fucking have a panic atack and what why be half this shit relatable I be overwhelmed what the fuck what the fuck",
          "prime example of this nate s episode introduce the concept of maddy lose her virginity she present to we how important it be for nate to take her virginity only to confirm two episode later that maddy absolutely be not a virgin when she and nate hok up for the first time and that she say it for his sake even with the posibility of the \" guy in his s on a beach \" story not be true and actually something rue make up by maddy s delivery of \" no \" and \" none but my own \" you could tell that she be half heartedly try to work he over so for it to reveal two episode later it may not entirely come as a surprise or come completely as a surprise depend on where you stand",
          "I be think that maybe she do end up kill nate or try to and somehow end up in a psych ward or something like a mental hospital and that be where she be narate from",
          "if fez be the last episode maybe he kill nate either in defense or to stop rue from do it herself or he could take the blame for rue it may delve into his background while also put an end to his character somehow jail or whatever it have also be mention that angus cloud be literally stop on the street and ask to be in the show never have an act carer so this may make it posible for they to cary on that storyline sacrifice a smal role to take responsibility of the murder they can finish the story they start and continue rue s story in the folow season",
          "I think he should stay past season especially with the idea of they explore his sexuality I don t think he s gay for be on grindr and talk to jule specificaly because jule be a woman who use the app I do think it d be an interesting window to open consider what you mention about his weird fixation on dick overal I just hope he get karma back to he and learn how to stop be so disgusting and manipulative",
          "jule may do something which would make rue think that jule be no long go to be a part of her life and in turn rue find no reason to live anymore and become a drug addict or may even od again and all the chaos end with they and probably nate while all of this happen lexi also sufer in some way just a theory any opinion be welcome",
          "just a theory but maybe rue know the way she look at nate and at jule show that she realize she must have be blackmail involve with nate what do you think",
          "the only reason why he be do that be because he think that jule have it out for his family yes it be horible but in his mind he be justify I feel as though if that confrontation betwen jule and cal at the chili stand during the carnival then nate would not feel as incline to blackmail her he distrust she because he fels betray by her he be start to build this conection with her and to he that all came crash down when he discover what happen with she and his dad be I justify his action absolutely not I be look at it from his perspective",
          "yeah good point about maddy even outside of the terifying abuse he try way to hard to prove himself to her a personal favorite moment when he obliviously buy she overly sexualize lingerie and her response be \" ew \"",
          "his name on the app be shyguy but then he later reveal himself as tyler when jule ask his name",
          "the only valid nate ship be nate prison nate a good ass whopin or nate death",
          "that s an interesting theory and would really further the story along in an unexpected way I definitely think there be something there betwen nate and cassie when it come to nate s thought on cassie as shakespeare say doth protest to much now it could be a hokup go south or I can see it be something so smal as be reject by cassie nate doesn t sem like the type of dude who will take rejection lightly either way this would be an interesting layer to throw into the mix",
          "I be look at the on demand menu on my tv and I see the episode description for next week it say something about rue help jule take nude for shyguy do anyone think that nate might use these picture to blackmail or humiliate jule in retaliation for what she do at the party",
          "omg I actually block out the fight club part I be just think of archie s absurd intro to the fotbal idea \" you have not experience the tril of high school fotbal \" and then the cherleader show up but the fight club be even more insane I do kind of wonder how the whole d d thing end though it be absurd but I do not hate it",
          "yo this be an important take I agree that nate have some curvature to his sexuality for the reason you state above and rue explicitly state early in the season \" nate be come to term with his sexuality \" you can tell he genuinely have a fascination with jule from the smiling when they be texte to he sit outside her house watch her to straight up make out with she near the lake and while this portion would not make he gay it could alude to a sort of pansexuality not unlike his father s which get to the important point that for man like cal and nate this be something that must be hide and repres they be strong handsome sucesful white man and they undoubtedly have thing tilt in their favor in life but while a rue have the luxury of fal in love with a girl and make out with she have her slep over often without ever really have to make a big to do about her sexuality these be life ruin secret for a nate or cal type nate so much as have a man s penis on his phone and the whole school gosip about it as some super scandalous thing whereas cal have to create a secret life to kep this from tear the rest of his world to shamble you can hear the pain in his voice as he cry to minako about how he just think he be do what be good for everybody obviously this all stem from the patriarchy toxic masculinity and the ridiculous standard it set for both all gender but this be a salient point as it show that in a case like this those most harshly afect be man which we often forget as in all other domain they be generaly more privileged",
          "I really hope rue ok and that jule set shit straight with they and doesn t hurt rue I hope tyler be free because he be inocent and that nate gets serve by fez and he do not get in trouble and that kat be ok and stop talk to crepy dude that will not even show their face and bee nice to ethan and that madie dump nate and get a restraining order and that cassie and mkay work through everything and that lexi do not feel to hurt and sad",
          "it d be pretty stupid of nate if the nude aren t totally nude to be honest",
          "I completely forget about the interview I do not see episode s interview yet anyway I think you have some really good point when she be look stres I asume it be because of how much rue depend on she and how she might have to break it off I completely forget about nate s threat I should have see that she be clearly stres when rue try to talk about the situation",
          "you make several good point in this post and of course abuse be never ok and should not be romanticize at the same time life be mesy and thing be not black and white it be also at tv show a simultaneously realistic yet sureal tv show with some soap opera flair in other word let people feel how they want to feel because it be all fantasy anyway it be really not that serious we be not watch a documentary with real people so I really do not understand the need to ridicule the nate jule shiper it be not like the show have not give they plenty of material to fuel their ship after all jule the character be stil somewhat conflicted about nate tyler as demonstrate in episode in she after the episode unfiltered interview even hunter schafer say she play jule as if the character stil have hope that a relationship with nate could work out because he be stil speak like tyler during the first half of their rendezvous at the lake at the end of episode she do not recoil from his kis until he crepily stick his finger in her mouth and that be when everything change but even after that moment of incredible heartbreak and betrayal it be would be unrealstic to expect jule ' afection for nate tyler to instantly evaporate that same expectation should aply to the nate jule shiper I mention all of this because it be clear the show be try to make some of the audience feel conflicted about nate jule I totally understand the fan who be clear eyed about the toxicity of any kind of relationship nate and jule could have I just think there be no need to claim some moral high ground above the nate jule shiper nobody want to see jule hurt if they want to fantasize or believe nate can change and actually be a love partner to jule who care like I say before it be all fantasy anyway",
          "yes one of the boy be nate and one of they be nate brother aron who be describe in the second episode as a fuck up they be literally be picture as a family father mother nate and aron the third boy be not there the third boy could be fezco but I do not know",
          "I think nate will end up with another guy and jule and rue will end up together",
          "I feel like nate say you rape she you fucking fagot while beat tyler up because of his dad he be definitely release his anger towards his dad onto tyler when nate watch his dad video as a kid I bet that he think it be rape I feel like this make little to no sense lol",
          "right after fuck the girl who do she make up have a fever dream about nate it be to real hit to close to home por rue",
          "I be sorry but I beg to disagre it be not like adopt an angry dog yes we can not change people at least be there for they be there for the one who be struggle to get well it be a real fucking slow proces it be really up to we the truth be we can leave \" nate \" alone or we can be there for he you know that be if he want I to be there if he do not then just look over at the corner lol if that person want to be well and they want someone we can be there for that person",
          "you clearly think she s be manipulate by the big bad nate and have no agency in her own toxic action",
          "I be pis because fez be aware that rue be in a manic state during that conversation and he do not even get a backstory to what be go on betwen rue jule nate nate just happen to walk into the store and fez take that oportunity without really think it through first or consider the fact that rue be in a manic depresive state it be a hasty thoughtles decision to call out nate in that moment and it be alitle out of left field because he sem to like to mul thing over and overthink in previous episode",
          "I agree that nate be slip into comic vilian teritory but the whole jule never really show recipocation interest in rue be kind of the point jule do something a lot of people do for well or for bad her heart be absolutely shit on so she go for the safe thing in front of she that s always treat she well and know for a fact be into she even if she didn t feel the same way she probably even hope think her feeling towards rue would eventualy grow change but as she s learn that s just now how it work",
          "rue how d it go with tyler jule he didn t look like his picture",
          "I don t know why you re apologize we could use a lot more think piece y take around here I think your take be spot on so first I have to credit the showruner and jacob elordi s portayal because they have truly leave the question of his sexuality ambiguous and open to multiple interpretation I myself have go back and forth and change my mind but here s my curent theory base on what we ve see within minute of met nate for the first time it be establish that he be interested in jule sexualy when he catcal her and run she off the road so there s also always be a thread of violence in the way he treat she next time they met be the iconic kitchen scene I m not joke give both jacob and hunter all the award for their performance in this scene what stil kind of mystifie I about this scene be the amount of agresion nate display towards this skiny pretty blond girl even if he be drunk and angry what kind of guy would act like that that lead I to believe he somehow pick up on the fact that jule be tran I don t think he s find she on the app yet or maybe he have even though she pas because she start her transition early he s be watch enough of his dady s tape to pick up on the very subtle sign below all of this agresion though be an undertow of well sex the way he say he want to give she some attention while he be way to close for comfort he be literally breathe down her neck it s honestly kind of rape y their whole dynamic be so fuck it but fascinating ok next time we see they together be another iconic scene at the lake again give hunter and jacob all the award he be not there to simply reveal his blackmail plan and entrap jule it take I a lot of time to try to figure out his motivation for kis she he didn t have to do that but he felt compel to because he definitely be sexualy curious about jule I think the fact that his dad who I think he love but also kind of despise for put his family s reputation and position at risk fuck her first make he super curious interestingly enough one thing the show hasn t mention be whether or not nate be arouse when watch his dad s porn other clue how angry he become when jule call he a fagot he have all kind of dick on his phone beyond the dick from white guy he would need to catfish jule why he do sem to have a genuine sexual conection with maddy although I think he get a lot more satisfaction out of their fuck than she do my conclusion I think nate be mostly straight posibly bi he doesn t really know his own sexuality yet because he be stil a tenager stil try to figure thing out watch his dady s tape and posibly be arouse by they really mess with his head perhaps he have all the dick on his phone because he be try to figure out where on the spectrum he actually fal the fact that he be physicaly atract to jule complicate matter even far and also scare he to death he think be gay be a very bad thing because his dad can t be open about it and he be to ignorant to understand that be atract to a pretty stylish blond girl who just happen to be tran doesn t really make he gay",
          "she could have take nude in the bathrom she doesn t describe the pic she take in there just tell rue she can t talk about they or something like that",
          "nate s dad s video nate beat up that guy tyler and extort jule rue s sponsor say a spech about how her sister will be afect by this for the rest of her life jule and tyler go to the police to clear nate",

          "look like fez be the one in the hodie who jump on nate probably with gun in hand doubt he could survive that scenario also be rue listening to her mother give she posibly fake eulogy",
          "I definitely think soi think that be probably why he do not want to acept that he be gay nate be damage and need help but I genuinely think he care about jule everything he say to she be true and he get weird and threatening but maybe that be because he want to make sure she do not leak anything because then it would tear apart the family and a lot of the time molest kid be convince if they tell their family will be destroy if she expose everything there will be an investigation into cal and his history and he may be reveal to have touch nate the one weird thing be that cal sem nice I genuinely if he know jule be under age he would not have go near her nate definitely have some sort of sexual trauma involve man though that be why he be so dominant it be his way of try to deal with it and make himself strong and it be what he be teach I gues we just have to wait and see but this be something I have be think for a long time I hope he get the help he need and then maybe can be friend with julesi do not want they together because rule but maybe they could stil have a relationship and conection platonicalyhis word be real he just do not know how to love or care about anyone",
          "I mean I think your to harsh on maddy she might ve be scare that if she didn t nate would hurt she or maybe she s afraid he ll leave her and in her eye he s well and love she more than her distant parent so that can warp a tenager view on right and wrong",
          "perez gets shot jump in front of jacob maybe jacob acidentaly shot perez fez jump out the window and do the race it might be one of mouse s shoter go to kill fezco and they have some sort of shot out it s rue but she could be halucinate cal most definitely want those tape and he hold nate against the ground or cal come in to tell nate that perez be dead or injure after getting shot rue go through more withdrawal and fight with her family I do not know that s just some of mine",
          "at this point every character will have comit statutory rape at some point nate s dad sem like he s go to be the only one really go to jail for it though with his video recording and internet and shit",
          "jule be rape she s drug out think she s fornicate with nate rue",
          "true I don t think that will actually happen I m not sure who will die if anybody do pray its not jule or fez",
          "when I find out that jule be tran I do not pick up any clue throughout the first couple episode only get it until she say it loud herself when cassie have her organism during carnival ride and people be watch \" oh shit \" for cassie nate have all those d ck phot on his phone and it kind of look like he be stil figure it out",
          "I be start to think he only do that to tyler because maddy have sex with he in front of the whole school she bruise his ego severely as far as we know he never beat up any of the other guy she \" cheat \" on he with while they be on their break",
          "I do see your point and yes this show show all humanity and real strip the human form it be very realistic and I do empathize with people who be in abusive relationship I have close love one who be thru that my post be mean for the one who blindly care for the situation and do not care at least you be a human being the nate fan I have encounter be od",
          "oh I like how you go off of the trailer I don t think rue and jule be go to completely stop be friend but I think the relationship aspect of it may be close to an end as jule sem overwhelmed by the presure it s put on her but I do believe they ll be able to stay friend and there win t be any bad blood I think it be fez with the gun as well but I have no posible idea how he could get out of the shit he s in with the cop at the end of episode I hope madie break up with nate for good but with how turbulent their relationship be I don t really know if she do leave he though I m concerned for her safety for obvious reason I believe rue be in the hospital for the kidney thing as well as she be in really rough shape last episode",
          "kat be in the proces of be doxe and we stil don t know which one be the black scren weirdo kat s story be distinctly not resolve there s some vague big picture closure fez wasn t head out to kill nate or mouse and end up probably not comit murder nate and maddy dysfunctional relationship back on rue doesn t chase jule maddy doesn t play the cal sex tape on the scren at prom",
          "as a reminder here s a list of those who have have their early life story sharedruemadynatekatjulescasiechriswho s mis from this list and need to get their life story show during the last episode for I I always want nate s dad to have his life story share but it doesn t sem likely",
          "be you new to the sub there have be so many I mean seriously post comment idealize they even comment about how nate act out of love it be bizare",
          "so first off let I start by say the clear vulnerability and fear in nate s dad when he ask jule not to out he be shock and I love that the writer give his character that side it be believable because rue say herself that cal own half the town he could have easily go right to threaten jule nate s dad be show in episode one as extremely intense and this quality be reintegrate throughout the show and even he have some humanity in he his son absolutely none terify anyway onto my nate theory unsurprisingly it sem to I that the writer have make thing dificult for we by give nate the good of both world he be both clearly fuck up with a ton of agresion control issue but he be also very much actually into jule nate watch his dad s tape from a young age which definitely would have impact his sexuality in some way however this be couple with the obvious stigma he knew suround those feeling and his dad s intensity lead he to supres a lot of sexual feeling and have a confused identity this be why I think his feeling for jule be real yes the end goal be sociopath be just to \" play the game \" and it be not out of the realm of posibility for everything nate be do to be some elaborate revenge scheme however I think to much be at stake for he to go to those length texte jule prime her emotionaly manipulate she etc he be clearly a briliant kid and a mastermind manipulator he could have find a different way to prey on she that do not involve so much risk for he he be careful yes but it would take one person see he with jule to have his plan throw back in his face I think he do want revenge for the fact that she slep with his father and maybe he do not expect to fal as hard for she as he do but those feeling be real in my opinion I think his threat of turn she in as a sex ofender be just his safety net no different than how he explain to tyler that it be justify for he to beat he up and that there be nothing tyler could do about it after nate beat tyler he esentialy admit he know it be not rape when he be joke about the entire thing with maddy I think his situation with jule be very similar I be really interested to see how the rest of the season pan out because I personally think it would have be very boring to find out that nate be in love good intentione or that he be straight up out to hurt jule",
          "just want to get some opinion on it her character be do good except now she have no agency when she have to ask mr white gangsta to take out nate",
          "edit there be also a clip from the trailer take off the internet of nate be hold down first glance I be positive it be rue curly hair dark skin some point out it be more than likely cal I m not convine yet",
          "nah I don t think rue kill nate in that scenario I think rue could get somebody to kill nate for she or jule though but I don t see it I think these will self inflict climax that be say I have no clue wtf be go to happen",
          "before jule and her dad be about to have diner shyguy nate start ask jule about her mom then he say his dad leave he when he be young amp that his dad be an ashole be he simply lie about his father leave to get more information out of jule about her mom or be he refer to his dad s more mental emotional departure from nate s life see as how rue say that nate and his dad didn t talk much perhaps nate s father isn t his biological dad thought I know I m overanalyze but I m so invest in this show right now lol",
          "yeah and even when she mention nate s dick pic it be because lexi tell she that be what she say so she be not completely an all know narator",
          "not sure she put everything together but she know nate be the reason for jule s out of character behavior",
          "I don t think rue be able to actually kill nate I think she ll come up with something else",
          "I just rewatche the carnival episode and I think you be right for sure we be go to have some kind of reveal about nate tonight",
          "this dude choke maddy stalk she and even have manipulate she in an abusive toxic relationship where even she have do bad for which I hold no sympathy for her I love she in the begining why be you make it sound like maddy be inocent in this relationship she s just as toxic to nate as he be to she",
          "what if nate be a molested child first of all I admit I be a huge rue jule rule fan but here be the clue of my theory the birthmark on his bely be repeatedly frame during his backstory in asasination nation same director sam levinson it be a birthmark that make recognisable the unknown sluty girl of the steal sex tape who have a huge colection of sex tape his father the studio be always lock and the drawer as well but we ve see a baby nate sit there wait for with anxiety but resignation his dad once again we know he hate girl act like boy and body hair he noticese madie because she be hairles he hate naked man in the locker room but he be more shocked rather than disgusted there s a persistent look of an adult nate inside the damn studio interupt by a surprised cal and again madie tell we there be picture of many different penis inside the nate s phone be he in contact of all his father victim if you consider this point of view jule dvd be mising because he s try to protect she before the moment those video will get out public the line how briliant be they in this serie betwen jule and nate sem to be more legit in this way I do not trust you either you be break inside you re so broken that you do not trust yourself and that be scary for you not for I all be dep knowledge of the pornography law be for this reason part of the plan something similir be in the plot of asasination nation as I say what be your opinion",
          "I honestly think that nate and jule be go to have some type of relationship I think maybe he be try to play she but I think it be go to evolve into something more when jule first visit his profile his bio say \" new to this not out no hokup look for someone something real \" I think there may be some truth to that maybe he feel like what he have with maddy be not real and he want to explore and he may also be curious about what his dad like about tran woman but if it be true he be not look to do anything sexual because he say no hokup but base on jacob elordi s interview I be not really sure because he say that jule be physicaly the problem so maybe he be try to get revenge I really hope not because I kind of ship they",
          "I be not ship nate and jule I just analyze the situation",
          "I think in jule halucination when rue say you know this be not go to end well she make reference to the fact that for jule thing will end up badly they probably win t end up together this season and I think something screw up be go to happen with nate sorry if my english be bad",
          "I think nate have a warped perception of sexuality due to see his dad sextape thus try s his good to conform into traditional gender role but in extremely toxic way but something I find interesting when rewatche episode two be when rue be go over nate prefered type of girl while it lead to believe madie be his perfect type I could not help but notice jule fit into his mold as well furthermore if he be into jule be genuine I feel it will far complicate his view of sexuality even more due to the misconception that be into tran woman be inherently gay",
          "stil not quite clear why nate tell jule his name be tyler I read that as he try to somehow ruin tyler or jule life even far since he s so calculate and evil",
          "yeah I think she know something be fishy betwen jule and nate she just doesn t know what it be",
          "rue and lexi as detective find gia carousel scene rue take fentanyl rue walking on wall jule dance in the club fly I to the mon scene nate jule side by side text scene leslie monologue at na the cast leave their house to go to the prom fez threaten nate jule and rue tripingrue be manic at fez s house transition into depresion",
          "I will admit I be a little \" slow \" sometimes but who be fez steal money from what operation be cassie get an abortion why do people hate jule after this episode what be rue arguing with her mom about what be up with that end rue singing with all those people",
          "I would be surprised if nobody die I think the show have be intentionaly craft a real sense of danger with its main plot I also think for this reason that it would be at the end of this season I can not imagine this season end without serious consequence so if we be to asume somebody will die this season then who I would say obvious maybe to obvious answer would be rue in some kind of sacrifice for jule and there be a ton of hint here the first would be her omniscient naration of each character she give at the begining of each episode she do not know these character back story in story so perhaps she have this knowledge in after life the second would be she be kind of a christ figure she be frequently in church give spech in na she already die and come back to life with she od as well her conversation with the guy from na be concern as well that one scene in the diner be kind of crazy sure she be ramble but she give this almost meta comentary on every character in the show about how \" everybody be just reach for something \" then the guy tell she that \" nothing in highschol last forever \" which rue sem to disagre with especially in regard to jule rue dying would surely prove that highschol and her relationship to jule do have lasting consequence also jule be somewhat suicidal maybe rue s sacrifice for her life would be for the sake of reafirm jule s life and this be kind of tenuous but maybe rue romeo and jule juliet be star cros lover destine for tragedy I do not know what do you guy think",
          "definitely that just let I know that he have some feeling for she in the episode synopsis it say that nate will reveal who he really be so I hope that be in regard to jule to kep that plot move",
          "whether it come from cal or anyone else nate need an aswhope lol",
          "when do she say she d stil fuck nate I mis that",
          "she should break into his house and beat he senseles like he do to tyler I would not stop watch that scene no clue what music but it should be badas hip hop track",

          "the only thing I disagre with be that in episode she be say she have no trauma that lead to she have the mental health problem they discover in her childhod her dad die after they already know she be mentaly ill so it be a trauma later in her life she just mean she have \" no reason \" as a kid to to have the problem she do",

          "for starter and context I spend my junior high year on tumblr and binge television start junior high be an emo kid who run a gle and grey s anatomy blog to the end of junior high run a girl generation k pop blog then in high school I have a part time job at a movie theatre job with of the employe be tenager who partie and smoke pot on a break after graduate high school class of I have a big alcohol addiction problem for a year so euphoria be a show I ve really manage to relate to overal which be very rare for I rue be an addict struggle with friendship have addiction afect her friendship be awkward and the gay panic with jule kis her if they make a storyline about her sexuality it s just to erie in regard to the one direction stuff I become a fan after graduate high school as my good friend have be a major directioner since the begining so out of boredom I decide to give it a try now I m completely invest in the group that I even fly out without my parent for the first time to see hary style live with my good friend that be say I completley detest lary stylinson not the idea that they posibly date or be a ship but to the extent that some delunsional fan be so convinced on it that they believe louis child be fabricate by their entertainment company to convince people louis straight and his long term girlfriend be also pay to be his beard however I ll get into that later as I mention in the title I think it be extremely efective in demonstrate the other form of escapism for gen z kid who didn t go in the direction of drug and party kat binging show in her bed eat dorito with brace find comfort in it after be reject due to her apearance find that love and create it with television show and musician isolate in her room on tumblr bitch I feel so see even though I wasn t tumblr famous I make my friendship online by a comunity of people who understand I in way that my real life friend didn t because it just wasn t something we have in comon I be an absolute nobody in person always pick last and feel insecure due to my apearance yet online I be notice and popular in my circle my apearance didn t matter only my personality and it be celebrate while I ve felt see very few time in different aspect this be the very first time I feel it with this specific aspect in my life in a short montage that s most likely never go to be touch upon in the show again to I escapism online with fictional character musician actor television film they be thing to I in reality the majority of that list be thing except when it come to the real people on the list that be when thing get complicated and the line on what the limit be becomes blur just as drug be an object it s how people begin to see the actual people who they be a fan of when they become so invest in a fandom even though there be sincere love and apreciation for people you re a fan of it become so blured when you treat fictional character the same way that even when you remember that they re real people it stil isn t proces like so so much so that it wasn t until the last year I m that I begin to feel truly uncomfortable with idolizing celebrity I admire so much I think the line be draw for I when I see fan acount for the kid in strange thing and the it movie even go as far to intensely ship the actor because they re all young then I in the context of what this have to do with lary I think it be important to have that animate scene as I think the consensus on it be that it make people uncomfortable and that s the point euphoria be mean to make people uncomfortable and have conversation on it show rue overdosing and his sister find her show jule go to a shady motel and hok up with a significantly old man jule talk about how she s be in dangerous situation to met with guy because that s how you can get afection when you re tran see fez and his significantly young brother be drug dealer etc euphoria be suppose to make we uncomfortable and have conversation about how this be reality for tenager I truly understand why fan be upset by it lary be something that have clearly make the boy uncomfortable and something louis have be extremely vocal about it ruin their friendship anyone who watch their interview and concert performance and just video of the group from the begining to the end can tell how distant they become with one another and the constant tension in the air it also make it bad as lary shiper be stil very present online constantly send hate and death threat to the girl louis and hary be date or spot with I remember see a twet from a fangirl get mad at louis say sorry my fanfiction with your friend make you so insecure and uncomfortable something along those line it s clear that a big number of the one who casualy do it don t see what s wrong with it this scene be so efective that the more I think about it the happy I be it be do with their actual name and animate the fan heart be in the right place the one who be stil around they know how uncomfortable this be for the boy and they re just angry that this be stil haunt they however the one who be vote for this scene to be remove be wrong just because something make they uncomfortable doesn t mean it shouldn t exist and it extend to louis even though the fan feeling and especially louis valid I don t like argument that well they re a celebrity and that s what come it if they didn t want to be one they shouldn t have because I think it s dumb and a big number of celebrity be people who just want to make music or movie t v and that s what come with it yes there be some people who just want to famous and popular but other just want to be artist but thing like this animation or mention of celebrity in show like south park it just happen when you re a public figure some people can take it when they re target and brush it off or find it funny or good on their part some people don t louis be one of those people who be very defensive and I get why he s a human being and the thing that come from lary treat he like an object however it be reality that people treat celebrity like object and this be a form of demonstrate one aspect of it and how much of a reality that be for a large number of people we have see it in way that people treat celebrity as object for profit treat their love live like it s a story line in a show this show that in a different way for different reason",

          "the episode s depiction of depresion be very raw and bring back a lot of dark memory about myself but it be a great reminder of how important it be to be on my medication and take it regularly because you do not even realize how easy it be to slip into a state like this be fully aware and feel like you can not do anything to stop it I be so grateful that there be medication out there that can stop these episode from happen because in the moment you do not realize how bad it be but watch it tonight on euphoria be deply sad",

          "it be such a savage mixture of everything all I can do be just sit back and get emotionaly abuse all over again lol",
          "I love how you sum this up I will say that you be right about they portray literal tenager so of course they be go to be impulsive and lack moral I think that see rue relapse be important for viewer because I think people see addiction as this thing that happen then disapear after one try relapse be part of the recovery proces and in any proces people relapse like try to work out everyday from not work out at all will take a lot of practice and will not happen the first few time you try nothing in life be concrete and it be good that this show stick to that I gues I think that it would end hapily but it do not I be excited for season",
          "be it crack that you smoke",
          "well prior to the club scene she be smoke wed and mix wed with coke or mdma can cause halucination also it could be she simply take a halucinogenic drug or could simple be drug induce psychosis",

          "the od be almost certainly heroin she start with liquid valium at the hospital at and have be chase that high ever since she use her mother s xanax before she be in rehab and in the time that she be out it be cocaine and posibly the fast act halucinagen which be why she be on the ceiling",
          "she definetely look like she understand the situation and take the fentanyl to avoid any conflict I be go to",
          "first of all I love the show and it be amazing but it be get one issue I rol my eye at every episode the portrayal of drug they show addiction in a great way just like opioid their depiction of mdma be fine as well but then there be scene with drug that just do not make sense what the hell do jule take in the club that make she halucinate nate she be take a bump outside so it must be powder she be halucinate but only he and have no other visual and she be dance without problem so it can not be sped coke mdma no visual ketamine she would have trouble dance or cb she would have visual which be all popular drug choice for club in the scene where she trip with rue they also call the drug by a different name even though it be obvious from the efect that it be mean to be some kind of c compound probably c b I love the show but as someone who know this stuff it be kind of anoying",
          "no I can focus on thing fine I ve never be to like a psychiatrist or anything but from what I understand if add adhd I don t sem to fit that I can usualy trace the origin of my thought when I get stuck on something it s always negative like a fight with a friend or family member or just think about the depres part of my life can be triger by see something I wish I have in a tv show or some subject in a podcast or a song on the other hand I can just have a shity day for no real reason the negative day definitely outnumber the positive one though but on the positive side it s lead I to try and understand what the heck be go on with myself and I might not have ever focus inward that much if not for it I hate to say that I have any kind of disorder it just sem to be insulting to people that be really deal with problem but also I relate a ton to both rue jule so I gues I m not as well off as I think I be",
          "it s call empathy and it s good you feel that way but you re right",
          "I love where the show be go rue say jule be a close second to do drug I wory for rue though because if she ever lose jule she would probably go back to use I wonder how many addict be just look for someone they can treat like their new drug someone to take their pain away in the same way drug temporarily do but my question be be it even posible to be addict to a person that intensely",
          "do you notice the fentanyl patch mouse out on rue after her first dose as well",
          "where do rue get the pil from that she snort",
          "you not a failure man do not call yo self that trust I I be around addict my whole life you be far from a failure you can end this or you can continue it be all up to you if you take a moment to realize the damage that you have do like because yo dad to be ill you will soon realize why it be bad I be about to pray for you man",
          "I have be in this same situation one of the reason why I love whoever write this be because they make sure to put ali in there and have he reach out to she early on and basically say if she need help she could call he nothing be bad than when you hit rock botom and it sem like you have absolutely no body to turn to it suck you feel dead empty and worthles and death literally sem like the only option that one person that ask if your okay or ofer a shoulder to cry on ear to vent to most of the time save a life",
          "this comment be pretty late sorry in the begining of her drug use it be mention she take her dad s oxycontin which be an opioid when she be for the most part it look like she be mainly abuse other opioid pain kiler I think she be also do cocaine throughout the show fez s drug dealer mouse give rue fentanyl in the second episode in the season finale I do not really know what she take it be also show that she take xanax on a daily basis this along with marijuana which many do not consider a drug and I be pretty sure you mean hard drug anyways that be only for drug she be also take alcohol",
          "never see it as a drug before",
          "I can t remember exactly but I m picture she wave her gun around in a crowd of people and there be several drug whose name start with that she may as well have be on bath salt as for halucinate someone clearly that s happen to I on al lad I see myself clearly as if I be actually there in front of I though I be have other visual efect at the same time",
          "what should irl people do if they be in rue position and they know it though",
          "I think it be just a case of rue run from one obsesive addiction to another nothing truly sexual just try to fil that ever exist hole but I be old so what do I know",
          "I completely disagre rue addiction be the center of everyone else s story it show everyone be addict to something rue set the base for that she have the typical form obsesion with drug that we usualy asociate with addiction but we also see what everyone else s addiction that do not relate to drug maddy she be addict to feel love even if it hurt hercasie addict to sexkat also addict to sex because it give she some sort of validation nate he s addict to manipulation of other and be the high powerjule addict to met with other man in order to feel validation there be more but this be just an overview rue set the tone for all these addiction and as we see hers addiction get well we see everyone else dig themselves into a dep hole without rue there would be no indication that these teen have an addiction to something the whole point of addiction be be so obses with something because of the outcome of how it make you feel or the euphoria it give you all the character experience they be own form of euphoria through there addiction okay I be do now",
          "sem like she prefer oxycontin and any opioid heroin her dad have cancer and they take those strong ass opanas or some shit she also take xanax which be like take a pack of ber to your dome when you abuse it that other shit the kid sell she when she trip with jule I do not know exactly what that it",
          "year sober and stil an active member in the room and can confirm this show while a bit sensational be pretty spot on",
          "this show be amazing and I find myself tear up at time my good friend pas away of a drug overdose sometimes I need he more day than other I wish he be here to watch this show with I",
          "rue be one of the most relatable character ever put on television to I personally I be diagnose with gad and asperger at four I sufer from depresion and I abuse my med I have be take a drug with the street name baby heroin since I be eight and have recently begin snort it to get high two month ago I be in an acident that only happen because I be stone I tear my acl meniscus partialy tear my mcl and pcl and fractured part of my bone they give I norco which I start pop like candy when ever I get lose in my own I have only snort it once though I make my father cry and make he physicaly ill with the stres I have cause he when my parent be not home I get high by smoke their wed I feel like a failure",
          "not comon but it be sometimes use like that and rue like snort her pil as the episode show and the color be consistent probably not od on it directly but it could exacerbate something else she do or be contaminate also someone point out the paramedic ask for narcan and ecstasy be not an opioid so your right that it definitely be not an ecstasy overdose",
          "since when do halucinogen euphoria euphoria be a feeling find in canabis amphetamine opioid disasociative psychedelic etc",

          "in which episode do they trip together also the halucination be probably from psychosis not from the drug and I m pretty sure it s coke coz snort cb be well not very pleasant",
          "understandable I come from a lot of addict and maybe I m more empathetic towards she because I understand her brain her addiction manifest with jule because she see it as something healthy for her but it actually become very toxic",
          "I think it s imply she use to pay he here and then albeit slowly and never fully before rehab",
          "she s not an addict it s not the same",

          "the scene I be ask about be only for the first od the scene with fezco be fentanyl but the first scene the botle wasn t a prescription botle promethazine codeine isn t as dangerous be mix with other drug as dxm but as you say I do notice she wouldn t have take enough to do much on it s own but I can t speak for it be use with fentanyl",
          "she could have outgrow that particular compulsion I get myself the ocd adhd anxiety diagnose trifecta as a kid as well and it do or at least can morph into a more generalized anxiety as you get old",

          "let I just say I admit I be more negative about the show in the first thre or be it four episode but then I just decide not to give a fuck and enjoy the show since I stil like it nonetheles everyone s a great actor the music choice I like and the cinematography be beautiful as well who care if at time the writing and plot be not as good I also have to give mad respect for a writer try to convey a story like this under eight episode that must be very hard so I understand his struggle with that so there be no judgement at all there but there be some thing about this show that get I really disapointed even though I m not that disapointed in it cassie and her pregnancy subplot the most predictable thing you can do be have a person who be promiscuous on a show end up get pregnant and they go on and do it anyway they couldn t explore another way to close her arc for this season regard all the mckay and daniel drama that be the thing you re go to pul her get pregnant we barely even get to see she as a full character yet this already happen its funny bcus people be always say either kat or cassie be go to be pregnant by the time the season s over and thus it happen amp xb jule and rue get together be force amp xb now now I love the idea of they become a couple they have genuine chemistry and whenever they be on the scren they steal the show but honestly they get together way to soon we didn t even see any flirty interaction betwen they or even jule show sign that she s into rue as well but then bom a kis happen and they be imediately see each other even then afterwards there be no sign I ve write this in two comment already but if they be try to convey that jule kis she out of she be vulnerable and be so desperate for a healthy romantic relationship that she decide to turn to rue bcus a she already like she and b she give she that tlc then they convey it well but if not then I m just so ticked off bcus the whole thing where the character fight with someone their see especially if the show then prove the person their seing be bad person after all which lead they to kis another character that the show want they to be with be so por and have be do time and time again and we can t even know what be go bcus of the stupid vilain nate plot that be ruin every oportunity to look more into rue and jule relationship we could go deply into jule feel presured bcus of she basically be the sole reason as to why rue be sober and tonight could ve be the perfect oportunity for it to have jule self destruct solely hence solely bcus that stil be one of the reason for act up bcus of have to deal with rue but then they make it more of that she be self destruct bcus of nate show up to her house and threaten her and that lead I to my next qualm with this show amp xb nate become a carton vilain amp xb his arc could ve be about how man s anger manifest for the bad or how he see those video of his dad ruin his view of sex but he literally out here do the absolute most he s just a vilain at this point not a teen who have anger issue he need to work on but let I give a moment to praise the actor who play he s act its so great I just get to give the dude a lot of credit even though he s now a vilain straight from a telenovela he be so great at play one especially that one scene where jule question why she would do anything he ask and nate just hold up the envelope with that certain condescending look on his face kis finger perfect amp xb let I just say I love this show so much I really do and it have improve on certain thing a lot and that just make I happy cus the show have so much potential I get the writer have only episode to fit in each character s arc and narative and that can seriously be rough even for a profesional like himself I know their and end goal in plan but often when you imediately have an end goal you be work for that mean have to make certain choice and sacrifice that can at time be bad in order for everything to line up for the eventual ending its happen with game of throne and it happen with a lot of other show",
