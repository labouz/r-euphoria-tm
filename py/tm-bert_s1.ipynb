          "for starter and context I spend my junior high year on tumblr and binge television start junior high be an emo kid who run a gle and grey s anatomy blog to the end of junior high run a girl generation k pop blog then in high school I have a part time job at a movie theatre job with of the employe be tenager who partie and smoke pot on a break after graduate high school class of I have a big alcohol addiction problem for a year so euphoria be a show I ve really manage to relate to overal which be very rare for I rue be an addict struggle with friendship have addiction afect her friendship be awkward and the gay panic with jule kis her if they make a storyline about her sexuality it s just to erie in regard to the one direction stuff I become a fan after graduate high school as my good friend have be a major directioner since the begining so out of boredom I decide to give it a try now I m completely invest in the group that I even fly out without my parent for the first time to see hary style live with my good friend that be say I completley detest lary stylinson not the idea that they posibly date or be a ship but to the extent that some delunsional fan be so convinced on it that they believe louis child be fabricate by their entertainment company to convince people louis straight and his long term girlfriend be also pay to be his beard however I ll get into that later as I mention in the title I think it be extremely efective in demonstrate the other form of escapism for gen z kid who didn t go in the direction of drug and party kat binging show in her bed eat dorito with brace find comfort in it after be reject due to her apearance find that love and create it with television show and musician isolate in her room on tumblr bitch I feel so see even though I wasn t tumblr famous I make my friendship online by a comunity of people who understand I in way that my real life friend didn t because it just wasn t something we have in comon I be an absolute nobody in person always pick last and feel insecure due to my apearance yet online I be notice and popular in my circle my apearance didn t matter only my personality and it be celebrate while I ve felt see very few time in different aspect this be the very first time I feel it with this specific aspect in my life in a short montage that s most likely never go to be touch upon in the show again to I escapism online with fictional character musician actor television film they be thing to I in reality the majority of that list be thing except when it come to the real people on the list that be when thing get complicated and the line on what the limit be becomes blur just as drug be an object it s how people begin to see the actual people who they be a fan of when they become so invest in a fandom even though there be sincere love and apreciation for people you re a fan of it become so blured when you treat fictional character the same way that even when you remember that they re real people it still isn t proces like so so much so that it wasn t until the last year I m that I begin to feel truly uncomfortable with idolizing celebrity I admire so much I think the line be draw for I when I see fan acount for the kid in strange thing and the it movie even go as far to intensely ship the actor because they re all young then I in the context of what this have to do with lary I think it be important to have that animate scene as I think the consensus on it be that it make people uncomfortable and that s the point euphoria be mean to make people uncomfortable and have conversation on it show rue overdosing and his sister find her show jule go to a shady motel and hok up with a significantly old man jule talk about how she s be in dangerous situation to met with guy because that s how you can get afection when you re tran see fez and his significantly young brother be drug dealer etc euphoria be suppose to make we uncomfortable and have conversation about how this be reality for tenager I truly understand why fan be upset by it lary be something that have clearly make the boy uncomfortable and something louis have be extremely vocal about it ruin their friendship anyone who watch their interview and concert performance and just video of the group from the begining to the end can tell how distant they become with one another and the constant tension in the air it also make it bad as lary shiper be still very present online constantly send hate and death threat to the girl louis and hary be date or spot with I remember see a twet from a fangirl get mad at louis say sorry my fanfiction with your friend make you so insecure and uncomfortable something along those line it s clear that a big number of the one who casualy do it don t see what s wrong with it this scene be so efective that the more I think about it the happy I be it be do with their actual name and animate the fan heart be in the right place the one who be still around they know how uncomfortable this be for the boy and they re just angry that this be still haunt they however the one who be vote for this scene to be remove be wrong just because something make they uncomfortable doesn t mean it shouldn t exist and it extend to louis even though the fan feeling and especially louis valid I don t like argument that well they re a celebrity and that s what come it if they didn t want to be one they shouldn t have because I think it s dumb and a big number of celebrity be people who just want to make music or movie t v and that s what come with it yes there be some people who just want to famous and popular but other just want to be artist but thing like this animation or mention of celebrity in show like south park it just happen when you re a public figure some people can take it when they re target and brush it off or find it funny or good on their part some people don t louis be one of those people who be very defensive and I get why he s a human being and the thing that come from lary treat he like an object however it be reality that people treat celebrity like object and this be a form of demonstrate one aspect of it and how much of a reality that be for a large number of people we have see it in way that people treat celebrity as object for profit treat their love live like it s a story line in a show this show that in a different

          "I think it be an unfortunate but comon story how rue be introduce to a slew of drug at a young age I also think it be very informative while still entertain how the show be give a good look at the positive and negative efect that drug have on teen expose at a young age and explain the proces of how it usualy happen what the outcome usualy be and who this problem usualy end up afect the most betwen family friend and the user the show do this all while cover a multitude of other issue pretty impresive and well think out",
          "when I be first diagnose with depresion and anxiety which I definitely know I have and still have the doctor quickly go to the conclusion of prescribe I medication the presure be there but my mother say no she know the side efect and do not want to risk it for I their second option be therapy which do not really work out for I and even then it still feel like there be a presure come from they to get I prescribed",

          "I be slightly confuse by the introduction to rue and her drug use what I gather be she be over medicate at a young age she discover if she focus on her breath she can cause herself to almost black out fully black out that s about it be her drug use simply her breathing trick be she od ing on her prescription be she take other rx drug recreationaly be she take traditional recreational drug I asume she smoke pot but hard stuff",

          "I think you re right I don t know any addict that bore they be the crazy people out there so the character be just a vehicle to link all the other storyline together I can t agree with dudethatsmysoup though addict be constantly chase euphoria and not achieve it after that st hit that s why addict be never happy no matter how many hit they have as they can t get euphoria they can never reach it think about it be an alcoholic euphoric when they be in a guter pe themselves or a drug addict with infected injection track on their arm they be heavily fed their addiction every day so would they be most euphoric people around right but they be the most unhapy and unsatisfied people you can met ask anyone in rehab",

          "in a perfect world sure she wouldn t have give rue the urine in reality she s a tenager and a friend she s know since elementary school be ask for a favor not sure there be many tenager in that situation who d have the mental wherewithal to understand the severity of addiction and why help she do more harm than good",
          "I think that be ketamine it make the room do a slow barel rol like that",
          "you chose to take drug that be on you not the man",
          "the episode s depiction of depresion be very raw and bring back a lot of dark memory about myself but it be a great reminder of how important it be to be on my medication and take it regularly because you do not even realize how easy it be to slip into a state like this be fully aware and feel like you can not do anything to stop it I be so grateful that there be medication out there that can stop these episode from happen because in the moment you do not realize how bad it be but watch it tonight on euphoria be deply sad",
          "it do not portray the inevitable self destruction that come with mania though mania be so dangerous and I feel it be almost glorify in this episode",
          "his line about drug addict be so spot on",
          "you know you be right have I not see the sick grandmother I probably I could see how that would be true",
          "in her situation I d probably do the same thing that s my good friend I be go to do what I can to help they no matter what but I d also wud not let it go I d have to talk to they about what there do after that at least",
          "it be call codependency look it up it be comon and there be both codependent relationship and people who be codependent themselves",
          "literally my life it go to so quick at I have a high school dealer the first couple week then bam I be chilin with a psycho who would regularly hold a gun to my head think I steal shit until he would find it drug be no fucking joke",
          "their mom play such a good wine drunk she be good as that character",
          "not really just because you be high do not mean you be go to open up about stuff a lot of people get self conscious when high and hold back more",
          "yeah because she drop the medication and have be self medicate with benzo and opiate we ve hear about her panic atack several time they show she have one as a kid she talk about the first time she have liquid valium with fez she have one when she have to talk about her sumer and she start to have one when she think jule be mad at her just because she have all those diagnosis doesn t mean she s go to be visibly experience symptom all the time especially if she s still pop pil whenever she can or channel the obsesivenes into her relationship with jule",
          "not sure about that but okand yes agree opioid be most likely",
          "no but I get easily could be rue kind of why I never date I need to be happy by myself not sure if I ever even will but just the idea of someone I actually like feel the same about I that would be a masive source of joy and what would happen when not if but when that person dump I for someone else not go to take that chance so I kind of be rue but post jule dump her and not addict to drug",
          "it be a socialy aceptable drug but it be still a drug and I definitely don t think a recover addict like rue should be drink even though it s not what she be originaly addict to her curent storyline be she become addict to a person so she s definitely at risk around an actual adictive drug",
          "if I recal corectly anytime she snort anything the scren go dark and she \" slow \" down if it be coke she would do the oposite it be also hela expensive and would not be worth the cost for an opiate addict",
          "everyone s talk about nate but honestly that entire montage of she recal her sumer be what be most impactful to I now I personally haven t deal with addiction nor do I think I know anyone who have but that scene be just raw emotion for I I couldn t stop cry and even now just think about it make I want to cry again kudo to zendaya nika and storm for act that scene so well and I hope we get to see more of gia and her relationship with rue they seem like they re close but so far we barely see they interact for long I want a scene where they have a real conversation",
          "I think her mania and depresion be portray well anxiety be show a good bit to like the end episode where she start to get anxious about leave town I do not really see many ocd incident though",
          "while you re clearly experience with the perspective of an addict codependency and the likely fate of their relationship it be worth mention that sometimes the right way forward for someone who be recover and will eventualy get through their struggle be bear out of the wrong reason it be not likely rule will endure forever and save either of they from their issue but it be very posible that thing will end amicably for they and their relationship could catalyze growth for they both down the road",
          "I fucking love the way zendaya be portray rue I have never feel so conected to a character and both the writing and acting be so realistic I hope she and the writer get all of the award they have do a great job of make her pain relatable",
          "I think be in love and be addict to someone be very different thing however it s easy to get they confused fal in love be mostly a healthy thing that everyone experience at some point in their life however get addict to someone a k a get obses with they be more of a tendency for people who struggle with obsesive mental disorder or just obsesive behavior in general and to answer your question yes it be very real and very painful it either end up hurt someone who gets addict by not receive what they be give or it can get painful for the obsesion because mostly the obsesive person get bored with they and proced to find a new shiny toy",
          "I be similarly anoy by an episode of homeland when the girl s have a psychotic break and she work out later on that she be on I a powerful halucinogen",
          "when you have ocd counting and thing like this be call compulsion they be not comfort they be a maladaptive response to anxiety as you perform the compulsion you condition your brain to pefork it more and more but it do not take the anxiety away but rather become an obesion get in the way of daily life ocd therapy involve force oneself to not do the compulsion sit in the anxiety and be ok with uncertainty since certainty be what those who sufer with ocd be sek example if I knock wod time that mean I be a good person and my family will not die if I fail then I be a bad person and my family will die this be not a comforting thing it be the compulsive part of ocd without know it rue s mom be actually do the good thing she can interupt the compulsion be part of exposure and response prevention treatment",
          "oh yes even as a non addict I think we all can get addict to people in life we all search for the thing that make we happy and for some the people in our life be that hapines when you can t get that certain person out of your head and every time you be with they you forget about everything else in the world to I it s as simple as a that",
          "this show do such an amazing job dig dep into how someone might become a teen addict you will notice how rue be expose to drug only through prescription drug she be prescribe a cocktail from a physiatrist who diagnose she with ton of issue this have be a big issue in from the s onward the over prescribing of child at the first sign of abnormality rue be diagnose prescribe and proced to go through a blur from age her parent be just try to do the right thing for her and be be advise by people who be authority rue fail to develop cope skil and have become acustomed to fix her mental emotional problem with prescription drug she be expose to prescription drug the second time when she be with her dad who be go through cancer he have an entire drawer of opioid and she curiously try one it feel like she be not reluctant to take one because of her exposure to prescription drug from prior in her life it also be an example of how adictive prescription drug have make their way into our life and how these prescription can often coincide with a stresful event there be probably a lot of kid out there who get their start from their parent s prescription at some point she have a panic atack and be take to the hospital where they administer her liquid valium again she be be expose to highly adictive substance in the care of adult for a medical reason no one be woried about her propensity for addiction no one be concerned about her age now in the aftermath of her father death her mom have prescription for xanax which she will take from as much as she believe be undetected as you will notice her addiction that we be show be always from a prescription and from right inside her home I think it be a powerful comentary about how child can be place on a trajectory from a young age and not by their own choice at all what separate rue from the non addict kid be her early introduction to prescription medication and her understandable curiosity about other medication what do you guy think I think this show be highlight the way addict can be make and how a smal seed can grow into something that become out of control her parent be just do as they be tell it be a comon story among milenial and z and it need to be tell her behavior now be an escalation of what be be go on since she be very young in the most recent episode she be show do one of the most dangerous drug with not a lot of hesitation we be leave wonder if she be truly destine to go down this path or if something could have be different",
          "if he stop sell they to her she will just find another dealer I do not think the burden of addiction lie on the dealer because when they stop another will just take their place but I think he should stop front her and let she feel way to comfortable about just go into his house without permision he need to set some boundary",
          "one bit that I love that they she would some light on be to how rue first fal into the spiral of drug and it be euphoric addiction rue be bring to the therapist where she be \" diagnose \" as maybe have depresion anxiety and biopolarism but \" she be to young to know fully \" so instead the doctor advise rue s mom to get medication anti depresant I be not sure if this be well aware but anti depresant or medication for anxiety be prescribe way to frely and even prescribe for patient that do not need it rue do not need it and instead have to sufer a childhod full of feel nothing who then eventualy take more of her med than she need to and want for a great feeling today to many teen begin their downfal into drug by be wrongly prescribe a medication they do not need",
          "she could have outgrow that particular compulsion I get myself the ocd adhd anxiety diagnose trifecta as a kid as well and it do or at least can morph into a more generalized anxiety as you get old",
          "she certainly do need to get her shit together but it be certainly hard to break bad habit I gues we will just have to kep watch to see what happen",
          "I feel like I would freak out if that happen but she might have make it all up in her head when she be on a high",
          "she go home and relapse though",

          "good point this could be another reason why fez be go cold turkey on her he could be do sympathize with she as she might not even be bring money to the table anymore so he figure he should stop give her drug for free as she have a serious addiction issue that be kill she",

          "where do rue get the pil from that she snort",
          "I notice that to I be not particularly a drug addict but I cyph a lot so I know that feeling of desperation when you expect to get your drug but you can not",
          "I can t remember exactly but I m picture she wave her gun around in a crowd of people and there be several drug whose name start with that she may as well have be on bath salt as for halucinate someone clearly that s happen to I on al lad I see myself clearly as if I be actually there in front of I though I be have other visual efect at the same time",
          "minor spoiler warning for ep so in the the party rue be act like she can t drink be she an alcoholic as well as a drug addict think she could still drink just not do drug but I do not know",
          "and be self aware doesn t prevent you from fuck up it just help you to see why you fuck up and then decide if it s something you want to prevent in the future or if it s just a part of you and it doesn t matter if it s good or bad",

          "its rue s story and she be the narator the story and even title of the show speak to her drug addiction she spend much if her wake life either in pain unable to focus bored or horibly sad the only time thing quiet down for she and she feel happy be when she be on drug or spend time with jule I find this post od because nearly everyone else advocate for the exact oposite of what you sugest that all the auxiliary plot line should be drop and that the story should more closely folow rue and jule alone zendaya be deliver amazing performance that honestly few of her castmate be match her character be a wretch she be not suppose to be likeable in her curent state you be suppose to be saden and wory about her while still want to see she improve she be a miserable frustrating character and honestly the only reason I watch final edit I do not see how anyone who watch the end if episode could justify skip rue s scene",
          "ya lol that be a typo I mean fent patch",
          "as someone with nesrely the same diagnose except major depresive disorder unipolar instead of bipolar fortunately though have be manic once or twice and be around a similar age I m not sure because the way they portray her think you do anything to get away I never let myself try anything as a teen while still low function becasue I know I d get addict due to the peace it would bring or maybe absence of minor despair but also it s hard to imagine her function well without sris balance with a lot of antipsychotic geodon be a bitch but each case can range in severity not everyone with ocd will physicaly harm themselves to satisfy a compulsion and not everyone who experience the depresion have the same length or low so there be variable basis of long tangent I believe both or plausible and posibly a misdiagnosis or excesive amount",
          "so they say she could have ocd add general anxiety and posible bipolar we see she take med for they but only her anxiety come up and only once",
          "understandable I come from a lot of addict and maybe I m more empathetic towards she because I understand her brain her addiction manifest with jule because she see it as something healthy for her but it actually become very toxic",
          "some people with depresion be also bipolar bipolar depresion this be why rue go manic which be say a few time and then she fal back into a depresive state it be a constant alternate cycle of very high or energetic point and very low or depresing point I have see it in person and it be not that far off",
          "I to be a few year off heroin agree with everything you say here about both the show and the experience I hope rue learn now but unfortunately that be so rarely the case I know I will be watch to see how they continue to handle and portray her character s development",
          "I notice it in her outfit on her way to the party in episode one and also in the way she just will not get out of fez s house only repeat her need for drug",
          "could be or could be because by drug like someone say there be a good amount of drug that supres apetite right now I can only think of wed and the munchie that can make someone stuff their face without thought",
          "the drug buy scene be intense and crazy the drug lord s predatory nature seem way to realistic and super cringeworthy it s an acurate depiction of how to lure addict in sex traficking it s funny how rue draw the line at fentanyl even though in real life the stuff be out of control among addict of course fentanyl be a legal drug mas produce from china I like how fez say that it s not good to draw attention from police by have customer od but the real reason be that have your customer die on you be bad for business",
          "it clear my skin",
          "it be simple math street value of vicodin be around a pil percs be the cheap at a pil oxys like a pil take pil a day to maintain an addiction would cost be around k a year to maintain of course she would need to up her dosage to feel normal so that would be even more expensive but I do understand that this be tv land not the real world",
          "I think the several diagnosis thing be a way to show that around that time kid be so often over mis diagnose and over prescribe med which be the major leading because to opioid addiction person gets injure and be prescribe an abundance of pain kiler till they run out of refil and be still in pain so they sek other drug I be ramble I hope that make sense",
          "I love their ship as a concept but I don t think that rue a recover addict should be with a drug dealer no matter how good of a guy fez be",
          "that and when she refuse to leave fez s house until he give her drug",

          "I actually think she might have a near death experience but not really be dead like a clinical death heartrate and breathe stop but then she come back it d explain the death like experience of have these vivid halucination and be able to interact with her deceased father the chest compresion choreography the bright light that she look to but then fal away from and would have be foreshadow by the I hear she die that begin the theory then when people say I hear she die next season sudenly acurate rue clinicaly die but be resuscitate just my own theory anyway",
          "hey got get sean bean and kill he after",
          "sell I on zendaya s act skil as well she s incredible",
          "I do not think anything happen to she I just believe she will become a more important character in season",
          "I honestly do not care for she at all up until this show she be outstanding in this role",
          "someone say in another thread they think rue be testify in court which sound plausible to",
          "I think it be more of like background into the character that be what they be reference",
          "she be kill it with this role I will never be able to see she as mary jane ever again",
          "I m think it might be a flashback of some sort",
          "I think she might she do seem to care about rue a lot maybe she will help rue later on as well she seem like she just want to be there for she",
          "I think your a fking idiot if you feel that way go dig out the last time she be on scren and have a field day if ema watson be in this show I wouldn t have watch it because nobody want to watch that shit show every week",
          "that would just make I hate the show like nar dude you don t just kill rue after season that be dog",
          "anyone here see the katherine langford paralel of reason why like make every episode for a different character perspective like she tell the story maybe she will die maybe she will od let s see",
          "well maybe not as a big reveal on how unreliable she be as the on in mr robot but just have how she view thing betwen she and rue be not what she think",
          "at the end of the series yeah honestly I see that she will lose fez probably at the end of this season and jule will also probably die a season or two before its end and she will believe she nothing leave to live for and probably will overdose and not come back this time",
          "one thing I have notice though be none of these girl ever take their makeup off like damn I do not know how you kep your skin so good",
          "to be honest the trailer aren t that bad for spolier it contain the information that will be in the fist minute of the next episode and a bunch of cut scene",
          "I really hope it will be the same actor I mean you don t just get zendaya and replace she after episode right right",
          "I think people be just triger happy on sexualize every relationship on the show she be just a swet caring friend in my opinion",
          "for anyone who be obses with analyze fictional character personality type what do you think rue or anyone else be",
          "he s only post what happen in the israeli version can t come up with anything about the other character because they re all different",
          "rue be an excelent character well write and very well play perhaps you yourself be have trouble conect with the character and her story which be ok not every character will be equaly likeable to everyone there be some character that I definitely would rather they cut out of the show p but just like in real life you got to take the good with the bad lolfor I rue be the most important character because her life decision and habit reflect mine in many way so there be an imediate conection",
          "let we hope it happen soon I think they tease it with the fentanyl episode",
          "I feel the same she may try to kill herself or something because she feel invisible",
          "rue can frustrate and anoy I sometimes especially this past episode I do not like the expectation she have of jule and how she be basically frown about she the whole night it be a side of she that seem really selfish to I actually she might not be my favorite character even though I love all of the character in their own way except nate because he terify I like I sit on the edge of my seat when he be on I think lexi be pretty damn amazing but I think her loyalty to rue cause she to make decision that might not be in character but she still do they I do not think she be a bad person at all and I think cover for your friend be a really normal thing to do at her age she clearly love rue in a way we have not see fully flesh out yet I do not think nate be anything else except for a psychopath and there be no excuse for I I do not give a crap what he find his dad do he clearly be more than just grow up with a mesed up family influence fuck up my most controversial comment be probably that the character of ashtray break my heart he be such a beautiful little soul and I feel so sorry that he be force to grow up so early and that this little kid be talk about drug and have a front in a hot dog shop he and fez they both seriously break my heart I love they both so much and I want well for they than the dangerous life of drug deal",
          "I like your theory but I hope that it be at least just an atempt I really like maude apatow and do not want she to be just kill of but I think it would be great if her briefnes of scene be build up to something",
          "she could be narate from the dead all the way into season and only her death be reveal at the end that have nothing to do with it",
          "okay so if true you re a bitch if fake you re a bitch but frfr I think you re just read the synopsis of the israeli version",
          "yeah I m wonder if the last episode of this season will be a reveal in the sense that we ll find out that rue have be exagerate or downplay some of the stuff that s be go on",
          "I also think it be weird in episode at the very begining right rue say sometimes when I get really high I think I m psychic and then she start tell nate s story I don t recal she start anyone else s naration like that probably nothing",
          "definitely efy be more of a perfect mysterious while rue be very rough around the edge and not so mysterious",
          "yes I like this explanation because you say she be a kid and she be talk and act like a kid I think this be the point of her monologue to bring adult viewer to her point of view where it might be hard to understand her motive or how the other character act without reminder that they be child thrust into adult situation this be how I see her exposition",
          "nah I don t think rue have it in she to kill someone remember how afraid she be of the gun",
          "if this show end wit rue oding n we have to wait another year or two to find out what happen I will be sad",
          "yeah if they want the show to not have a s for eg if zendaya get a big marvel role I can see that happen",
          "yeah but that do not really mean she be I think about that to but I think she be old",
          "that be fine it be just not how the person play the character be interpret it",
          "rue be go to overdose and die when jule break up with she and she be narate from the great beyond that be why she know all the detail about the character",
          "the whole crush up pil in her school bathrom remind I of this kid who sit next to I in chemistry he bust out a vicodin during a movie for the class and crush it up and snort it I didn t say shit because he be my friend but wtf man",
          "honestly be easy to mis if I have not watch zendaya do that same peak over in far from home the day before watch that episode I probably would not have notice she do it and therefore would not have notice what she be peak at and it very well could have be a different set I just put and together",
          "holy crap jackas be an old people reference now",
          "the back story be for the high scholer and all of the main high scholer back story have be cover",
          "she s say she s an unreliable narator and we only get the show tell thru her pov so I think we ll find out soon how unreliable she s be",
          "I do not understand why everyone be say rue be go to be dead by the end of the season zendaya have confirm that rue be base off of sam levinson s life which can most likely mean rue get her life together and become sober",
          "I m not on board with rue relapse that be most definitely her flash back to the past right after her father die fast forward to the begining of the first episode fast forward to the end of the finale aka the music video",
          "I think her famous parent may have a little to do with she rank in credit she really be do an incredible job give such a strong performance with very few line and speak scene",
          "its still a relevant question to ask its not a typical character and the th wall be break but that do not answer whether her knowledge be an indicator of what happen plotwise or if its just a conceit of potetic license could easily be that she be dead or it could be that she be tell the story from year in the future or neither this show be definitely in the detail so I doubt something that big mean nothing at all",
          "well zendaya s awesome but there be other character who re like steam train I be go to jule kat nate and maddy be obvious example but cassie s a slow burner I be go to and lexi and gia have scope",
          "ok so obviously spoilersi read that rue be suppose to end up kill nate in the original script and that get I think rue be narate the story in a past tense but to I it sound like she be not only tell the story to we but to someone else as well you all remember that detective in the last eat episode detective riley throne who question jule I have a feeling that if this do end up happen that detective riley will be the one interogate rue just a thought",
          "I agree good rue so far",
          "people be take this whole second biling thing way out of proportion algae smith and sydney sweney be borderline peripheral character and they get much more story depth and screntime than maude biling order do not equal story significance or screntime",
          "why would they kill there star character in the first season that be stupid",
          "just because she be dead doesn t mean she win t continue to be the narator rue be tell her life story from the other side",
          "to I rue be the most relate able of the character",
          "just because the same actres character be narate a story do not mean they be the same an in story character as the narator help the audience to relate well to the character especially the main character",
          "if rue end up in a mental hospital then I be go to die",
          "I see it come from the moment they met maybe just because I be hope for it but you can see how instantly into she she be and how painfuly unreciprocate it be I really hope that change but I don t really see the show go in that direction",
          "she be the girl who be handwrite the note to kat of daniel break up with she be in and we do not know anything else about she or what happen to she",
          "in particular for I the scene of she on stage try to talk about her sumer her ask jule not to be mad at she in ep and she yel at fez through the dor be all so good I tear up at all of they",
          "why would they want to copy reason why that be just stupid rue be not die",
          "yo do ya think that rue be already dead on the series",
          "when do she mention that I do not remember it",

          "I just want to point out that it s freak awesome that rue should be such an explosive and provoking character give her storyline but really she s the baseline she have a sympathetic story and her choice may evoke anxiety for the viewer in the moment but really at least one episode in as hard as her trip and high be she feel steady predictable timeles the same reliable almost even though she try to imply that she isn t when it come to storytele flat and observe she move we through the world of euphoria in the same pace and monotony she s come to find comfortable with her own elixer of drug and detach sense of belong as much as we can t let ourselves agree with how she get through the day we take comfort in her cycle as much as she do which give the other player that absolutely have a story to tell the chance to do so as colorfuly and realisticaly as posible only rue could be the fade out we all forget in high school and at the same time coax our attention through the story so efortlesly",

          "I personally think it be suppose to be rue point of view as opose to it actually be what be happen but that being say rue literally admit to be a potentialy unreliable narator in one of the first monologue",
          "his acting be just right for his character I like how he be able to portray a convincing sociopath lol I feel all the character be convince I can t think of her name but maddy s friend that be constantly vape I feel she be the perfect person to play that character her face and personality match",
          "she narate first person in episode it be def rue not zendaya",
          "it s hard to decide who I love most in this show lol but rue jule absolutely kill it in this episode she solidify herself as one of the most bad ass character in any show she be the personification of hope",
          "amp xb I m not sure what s about to happen in this scene but can we talk about this bomb ass outfit she look like a private investigator who s about to fuck someone up real properly with those suspender and clicky pen in her breast pocket plus her eye look like she s out for revenge rue doesn t normaly wear clothe like this so what do you think she s up to my first thought be that she s go to go to the police station and front as someone else but I know that make no sense",
          "her face and makeup be maddy in the instagram pic the body look out of place because it be just sit there it be not go to look the same on scren with lighting and cinematography and the other actor",
          "I do not know if you all remember but right before the drug dealer come to his house rue see something in the other room like a lady sick in bed hospitalize I wonder if they be go to explain it in the next couple episode what do you guy think it be his mom maybe just something I be think about",
          "now that it s be renew if she doesn t have an episode this season she ll definitely have one next season",
          "people probably think the same thing with sean bean on game of throne I hope she stay but her movie carer be take off so I do not know",
          "well she do say she be psychic I think that be the producer s way of get everything involve in the story",
          "I think the spot light be her imagination halucination",
          "she need a narative purpose she s in every episode but we only get a single scene with her maybe a quick shot to but that s it we know a few thing she have no friend episode rue say they grow apart but lexi say in the bathrom rue be her good friend ep she s by herself during the pep rally ep when cassie be get ready she s do homework and disconect from the group lastly ep we see her left stand alone when jule and rue conect and gia leave to see her friend she s a hard worker we get this in her episode scene mention above maybe she feel presure to suced so be under stres no romantic relationship she might not get attention from boy because her sister be cassie home life isn t great her mom s an alcoholic no father that we know of I think she ll maintain one scene per episode her death will be end of ep or begining of ep she ll be the focus of ep her death will reflect how suicide s unexpectednes because we be self absorb but if you look you can see the sign sign that her family clasmate and we the audience ignore",
          "I feel like she be I just hate how she encourage rue to stay clean and threaten their friendship over it yet she do drug herself",
          "if they kill off rue they kill the show I be go to if anyone kill themselves it will be cassie or kat",
          "who call her ghost why",

          "she be not be dead the entire season jesus christ people interact with her",
          "she be also wear the same outfit in the upcoming episode",
          "she be a \" zack moris \" type character she break the fourth wall the show be not your typical hbo drama the whole \" dick pic \" tutorial be the most obvious example",
          "rue will die I be hypothesize that it be she narate the story from the dead as much as it pain I to say it I can not see a happy ending for she",
          "it s how the season finale end rue break the fourth wall at the end",
          "yes but I would not mind be wrong since I love rue",
          "it would not make sense to kill rue because she be a reflection of the creator of the show and he be very much alive lol",
          "I mean rue be the main character of the show the series be obviously go to have she have the most scren time of anyone the series isn t about jule it s about rue and her journey at the end of the day jule have so much scren time and have a tran actres play a trans character be amazing for representation her character be the focus of next week episode how be any of this transgender discrimination and as other have say rue isn t suppose to be likeable she s suppose to be frustrating and maybe you don t relate to the storyline which I respect but there be dozen of people who have say they relate and find find the story very reminiscent of their own experience which we also have to respect",
          "ema watson be almost lol I do not think she could play a high scholer",
          "make sense I never notice that when they lay down I be wonder the dame thing only because it look like rue be finger dj jule in the new episode thank for point that out I be get confused its even well kind of hot that jule still have it",
          "care kind trustworthy loyal",
          "that be the part I could not figure out since she be wear the hodie there be to much back and forth with the scene for I to kep up at first I be like \" oh this be the first time she oficialy spiral \" but then her hair be down and she have gliter on her face so I do not know",
          "I like how it be leave ambiguous same outfit from when her dad die but dance makeup it really highlight the cycle of substance abuse can not wait for next season will we see rue recovering again or still use I be not sure her family can so easily dismis her behavior this time though I hope",
          "that s my interpretation that s why I don t watch cast interview I rather watch and make of it what I see",
          "it be not my desire to imply that the question be irelevant I be provide my interpretation of the character s knowledge and how the show runer utilize the character it be a borderline second person point of view",
          "trust I I love a sociopath for year and year and year even know the truth love sometimes suck mainly when you be",
          "yes I have this thought as well this have be a long stand theory for sure and on the top of the choir \" hil \" there be a bright light definitely cros my mind good catch on the dad hug",
          "I just watch it today and I do not even recognize who that be I do like her even if she enable rue I do think rue be really mean to she unfairly",
          "also make I believe her role will be big than we be be lead to believe but to date she seem more like a teny part of an ensemble cast",
          "oh yeah yeah I totally agree I be just say she would have be a goo choice but the way they have it set up already be great",
          "every time she be on scren she convey this longing and pain in her eye someone say we have all be this person look forward to see the piece she hold to this beautiful tapestry of tenager",
          "I be curious about that to but then I notice she be high in the credit because the cast of more major character be list alphabeticaly since her last name start with an a she be first",
          "um there be a second season there be no show without rue so I be sure she do not die",
          "ugh she be so briliant give my good sis zendaya the emys she deserve",
          "ema be a great actor but I think she s a little to old for the role sometimes I have to forget that zendaya be old than the person she portray on the show",
          "yeah the begining of each ep be a minute dive into a character s backstory psyche",
          "I don t think there be any reason to believe she s dead or testify or any other theory as to how she can narate the story I think it s a poetic license that they use to tell the story and rue be the perfect character to do so it s the same reason she can break the fourth wall presentation scene about dick pic",
          "only thing I think she s go wrong be be an ashole to ethan and slep with random dude at her age nothing wrong with casual sex just not as a tenager other than that money pig exist there be trove of man out there into findom so she s not a bad person for that on the other hand it s distort her view of man and that can be unhealthy she need therapy but realisticaly speak it s not go to happen the parent in this show with the exception of rue don t really look after their kid that we ll so they don t know wtf be go on",
          "I think I d stop watch",
          "I notice it on ep right away when rue and she be lie down the couch",
          "thank you for call she that lol she would apreciate it a lot",
          "yes the clip where we see maddy and she look a mess we only see her face wear the white tank and burgundy track pant",
          "I be just like \" wow they do not wash their face before bed \" after see rue still have all her makeup on when jule be knock on her window the night of the carnival",
          "rue probably be right the whole rue be the omnipotent narator trope make it super obvious unles it be a misdirect",
          "be it just that your used to she act a certain way so you can t get into she act like she do in euphoria because I love she act in this show and many other do as well not just fan of it like those you d see in here but other that criticize tv movie for a living",
          "these show have wardrobe department so there be a lot of custom make clothing there will not necesarily be clothing straight off a rack that you can buy I wish you luck in find these",
          "ugh efy stonem be one of my favorite fictional character of all time I agree w what you be say but I definitely think we eventualy see the very dark tortured soul side of ef people always tell I in high school I remind they of her look wise and style she be my ultimate style inspiration",
          "new character narate flashback with rue probably not though",
          "no it would be a masive departure in levinson s style to have a woman die in something he write",
          "there be a lot of that this episode extreme contrast lighting on face same thing during fez and nate scene that be col that it could stand for bi polor for rue maybe just overal a visual representation of two opose force at play",
          "yeah that be the one I have not watch it but if it have no resemblance then that make I feel well she might be dead because she be the narator though",
          "sorry for my english sorry for the picture quality I kep wonder if the light here bright side shadow side on rue be for acentuate the bipolarity kind of reme I of nolan in the dark night kind of do the same for harvey dent two face to show the dark side of he slowly come out during the movie",
          "yes it s just alphabetic order if anyone should get second biling on this show it s eric dane who have an establish carer yet his name come after angus cloud who be play his first role ever lol so yeah just alphabetic order",
          "so you re just go to kep say what happen in the israeli version that s all you get",
          "through be pretty much guarante and be maybe would tie into somehow I really really don t want and to happen both because I really like rue and don t want to see she go through that again and because I think it s a little predictable a path to take",
          "nah I definitely think she dead",
          "I really think she be bad actres until euphoria I didn t consider the disney role I see because I don t think it s always a great way to know if someone be good or not can t say how she be in the musical movie because I never watch it I think she bad in spiderman homecoming but look back after watch euphoria mj be just one dimensonal and I didn t like her personality she really have an oportunity to shine in far from home as mj and peter s romance be play off awkwardly really well and realistic for their character who be experience their first teen romance zendaya and tom just have great chemistry I think it just feel weird because she s really just begin her carer and far from home come out during the begining of euphoria I can t recal a time I watch an actor actres while a television show be air and then another movie they be in during that period also I think because she just have a few line in homecoming mj wasn t fully flesh out and we re really just get to know she in far from home so have euphoria just begin see her portrayal of rue and then she properly as mj be just a weird feeling I m excited to see a range of character she ll play and I hope she isn t type cast rue and mj be different but also similar I hope this isn t just a period of a few year where we see she in leading role and then cast director pretend she doesn t exist I think she have amazing potential to be a great actres and win over people who doubt she",
          "he be an addict he can not quit sell drug and he be no long in control so he be try to take back the control they kind of all be in the finale",
          "for I it be kind of the oposite I have always love efy but I be start to dislike rue",
          "her naration seem to know everything relevant to the story regardles or not of whatever the character actually know those thing she also speak in past tense do you guy think she be dead maybe she be in purgatory or something maybe the god or whatever be decide whether to put she in heaven or hell just some theory would love to hear all of yal",
          "either his mom or his grandma it wasn t really make clear who it be in that bed",
          "yeah I know just wish they have chose one of the well character to focus on",
          "so after rewatche the first few episode again something ocur to I in the very first episode rue explicitly state how she be not always the most reliable narator that lead I to think that a lot of stuff be show in the show be actually rue not know what actually happen and fil in the detail this could mean that everything that happen when rue be not directly involve might need to be take with a grain of salt any thought or idea",
          "probably a rehab flashback",
          "I be asume the rat mouse emoji that the poster put here indicate that rue will be rape by mouse in this episode I could be very wrong and I hope she doesn t but I gues we will find out in about hour what ever do happen o",
          "any theory on rue s eneagram type",
          "I mean they have kep the rue and jule thing in the background since the early episode it s the backdrop against which everything else unfold",
          "anyone else thinking she totally take the old lady s medicine I think after whatever dramatic shit happen in the finale she s go to go home and take those drug and that s how the season be go to end",
          "zendaya have a low voice doesn t help either lol",
          "pretty sure that scene be a flashback to her dad s funeral",
          "fact I have never be this atach to a tv show zendaya be play her role perfectly I be go to",
          "rue be the heart of the show so no I do believe that they have many good character but rue be one they",
          "I honestly think rue be dead I m do a re watch but there s a line that she say that make I really think she s tell the story from when she be alive I don t want to think this of course but she be an unreliable narator may be because she s a drug user so her perception of thing be distort",
          "narate from death seem like a reach posible but not likely you don t secure zendaya as your lead just to kill she off after episode",
          "exactly and their personality be both similar it be just mj be pg every time I see she I just think of rue I be sure it euphoria do not exist zendaya would still give off a disney channel vibe and make that end to far from home even well I gues marvel should just not release a spider man movie in the midle of a euphoria season that brutaly honest character in homecoming be literally nothing compare to rue",
          "I think that the most boring part of the show be the whole rue and jule part everything else that be go on with the other character be far more interesting to I",
          "yeah the bitch hela fire",
          "yea I do not think she will die to much of an intriguing character",
          "I think it would be weird but for I she be just one of those actor that completely become the role and you do not even remember she be act",
          "that be exactly what I be think I honestly think he be the good actor on the show",
          "I know rue be wear a gosha tee when she be get her drug",
          "it s an interesting theory but I feel like it would be crush to have something like that happen to her and if ali be her uncle then rue mother would have know that she be lie about be clean and go to meting",
          "it be a leo dicaprio movie and rue be dres as jack dawson from titanic so maybe his movie will afect the ending of season",
          "a lot of people be talk about how zendaya play mj and rue similarly but I think that they don t have much more in comon than any other two emotionaly close off tenager I mean the close mj have come to drug be bring espreso in venice it s definitely col drawing comparison but I still think the role be a testament to zendaya s breadth as an actor",
          "zendaya make the show she be amazing",
          "if you ve ever see the bling ring you would know that ema watson isn t very convincing in the party lifestyle",
          "I love efy and rue so much",
          "I feel like she be do a fine job though I just realize that she and cassie be sister",
          "I completely agree there be so many aspect of different character life that I can directly relate to I can not even tell you how many time I watch the trailer and try figure the plot out lmao",
          "ned stark the north remember",
          "some other people say that this \" inatention \" towards she be intentional probably to set up for she as a turning point for the show",
          "or be that just the plot",
          "rue say cassie never tell a soul about what happen but then how would she know the only non rue be dead answer I can think of be if lexi wake up and hear or see what happen and tell rue some time afterwards",
          "I have no idea she be in it didn t see the last one but that for sure make I want to see that one",
          "she s to old and to be honest she isn t that great of an actres",
          "rue comforting a notably break jule she s wear the exact same makeup with the rhinestone from the carnival preview of episode I gues something go bad",
          "no you can see her pe and aim in the new episode thre",
          "I kind of hope we get a mr robot reveal in the finale and see that everything rue be talk about be totally off",
          "she could be narate in past tense because she be dead",
          "I think that comit murder would ruin rue s character unles it be self defense",
          "comin back here to say bih you be right tell the future no severe spiral from rue yet but you be right",
          "I think this show be suppose to focus on each character rue s character be unlikable anoying and quite frankly ofensive to people who go into rehab like I seriously I could smel her and why be a great character like jule overshadow by rue she be the real star of this show this be discriminatory against the transgender comunity and for those of you defend zendaya you be a part of the problem",
          "rue be not a catch either though be honest",
          "for that she need to learn everything about every big character s past I don t feel like she have a great friendship with most of they something would have to happen for she to know all character that dep and how unrealistic would it be I mean she d have to learn about clasie s and mckay s first time and that s just not something that someone would tell a mere acquaintance",
          "so rue relapse when she be do the line on her bed she have the same exact makeup on",
          "I agree with you but oh my god now I m desperate to figure it out do this align with she be the all know narator be season two go to be without her I m stres tf out",
          "she be literally a high fashion model irl but go off I gues",
          "you re in the minority on this one she s be fabulous",
          "hunter schafer need to see the impact she s make this be really nice",
          "from death note do not know if it be just I but it be probably the darken eye and fast talking detective stuff that make I relate to it",
          "you mean the israeli series I watch it and now I can say it have little to no resemblance to this version so I wouldn t say rue be dead just because the girl in the israeli euphoria die",
          "yeah I think I remember somebody actually say her sister find she on the flor I be just try to figure out if the od scene could posibly be flash forwards",
          "I love this side of rue and I think we ve be see a lot of it since she start try to stay clean",
          "lmao yes I see it the same exact way during the car scene I turn to my friend and say \" tell I she be not jack sparow \"",
          "I think she be refer to climate change very subtle but very efective",
          "all the other character be much more interesting both visualy and relate to storyline to I rue be by far the most boring character of the show her voice be so monotonous it make I want to scream all she wear be ugly hodie all she do be take drug that be not even the fun kind amp pine over jule who could do way well she be sort of pathetic I wish the show do not include she even though she be the main character anyone agree",
          "my boyfriend first point this out to I after the scene in episode where rue saunter up to the girl car and say \" why thank you \" I find this hilarious when I notice it again in episode when she finese she na paperwork getting sign and say \" pleasure do business with you \" anyway else see these little quirk",
          "but we have not see anything of she yet",
          "have a solid reason to comit suicidethere be no solid reason to suicide",
          "that and the begining of the music video be a representation of she stumble through life after her father s pas such a beautiful ilusion of pain struggle and dispair",
          "I do not see how that scene show anything but ok I be still not sure but use that scene as an example do not really make I believe that she like she but to each their ownedit so I watch the scene again on youtube which the scene oh my god it be so amazing I can not and I try to see what you be say but I only see that she try to pul zendaya s jacket down so",
          "nah see childish reckles jule be heartbreaking and a tad bit anoying pls do not take this as I dis her emotion she have every right to feel the way she do I be just say still even behavior like that can be anoying to witnes I hope she get well though",
          "she have so much potential consider this be her first act role and she s already kill it zendaya have step up as well",
          "but have rue be unreliable so far",
          "I think its posible she change into it when she get home consider the her emotional state and the meaning behind the hodie",
          "I do think she be a col chick and very likable",
          "the reason I suspect it be because of the imdb cast list for eps and she s not list in the main cast for those two episode which be sus if I remove that factor I do not see any plot base reason for her death",
          "be not she suppose to be claire dane in r j most of the girl be dres up as cult movie character maddy be jodie foster character in taxi driver I gues I age myself whop edit another girl be thana from ms",
          "I think that she might have just be change into another bra and panty set",
          "also I feel like rue have a very vivid imagination maybe it be because she seem like a loner and they talk about all of her anxiety also how she mention that first time the doctor give she a drug can not remember which one she say that be the first time her mind be quiet or something of that sort",
          "yes I love her lol vape every second and yes bitch all her friend",
          "this be my first time watch the series and I just find this post because I literally google to see if zendaya purposely incorporate captain jack sparow into she act after this exact same scene",
          "also cos her carer be go to blast off any second and this show take a lot of time to film compare to movie",
          "well I say they ve heroic quality not that they re hero macbeth and othelo have heroic quality but neither be a hero but I do hope for rue and jule they re kid whose action mean terible risk but who have great promise also regard specific heroic quality there be many that might be consider but obvious candidate be rue s ocasionaly unspare honesty in spite of her sometimes calous behaviour and jule defiance in the face of all danger in spite of sometimes put herself at risk regardles of the consequence for her love one should thing turn nasty",
          "thank you I think she be amazing I be so glad she exist",
          "they can introduce all they want rue be a text bok unreliable narator because her perception of reality be distort by the amount of information she have by the fact that she s a proven liar op s on the money and viewer should never trust a character word but only their action",
          "it be really nice to see that they have a scene about the fuck up shit that can happen with dealer I be kind of scared that rue would be another one of those character who be a stuningly beautiful addict and we would only see her good moment this episode change my mind and it be very pleasing this be something skin never do and although the two be very similar I think I be go to end up like euphoria",
          "exactly like I think he have be make to seem nice and loveable so when he crack it will be surprising thank for remind I of the foreshadowing",
          "it s also the name of a pornstar",
          "just to clarify I be not super invest in the show so I may be totally wrong I watch episode one with my girlfriend and think it be alright and I have not see every episode but I have see or of they when my girlfriend be over because she really like the show I do think the character have be flesh out really well since that first episode and I will probably go back and make sure I see every episode because I be enjoy watch it now but in episode one and now when she talk at the begining of the episode rue do not sound mature like I think the show be try to portray her she obviously be mature base on what I have see she do and say in the episode but in her expository monologue thing she seem like that girl we know in high school who be just as mature and \" grow up \" as everyone else but be a bit smart and more able to put what everyone be feel into word and it make she come off very r imandthisisdep I be not insult the show because honestly it seem like that be what they want she to come acros as and she be definitely the most likeable character in the show I have grow to like it a lot more since that first episode and I be enjoy see all that be happen but I be wonder if I be alone in feel this way because my girlfriend seem to think rue be this super mature paragon of clear thought and maturity and I just see she as a good person who can put what she be think into word well enough to make sense anyways tl dr do you think rue be mature and wise beyond her year or do you think she be just a good person who articulate herself well",
          "ya but I be talk about the original od",
          "he be the most honest character in the show he do not lie to himself or other and tell it to you straight",
          "yeah I agree she seem like a nice person to and probably the only normal one out of the group lol I wish we could know more about her I actually find she to be quite interesting even though she might not have as much go on as the character if that make sense",
          "and rue do explain about herself in time soo",
          "I would like to see she go detective mode a lot more next season maybe a little in the finale if it make sense",
          "just can t see they secure zendaya as their lead and kill she off after episode",
          "her naration be genuine I feel they re introspective and to I they say a lot without beat you over the head with sentiment now there be time when she s high and have conversation with fez where I feel she s just wax philosophy without say anything also ali call she out in episode when she be ramble on about fake people in her school in general though rue work well in her own head and as a narator to the audience her character be socialy awkward and withdraw most of the time which make sense with her anxiety she seem to be get well as of this late episode when she s confident enough to excuse herself from stresful situation and explain that she doesn t feel comfortable without instead just use and turn inward and tell we how great it be to be high kep in mind she be a year old kid certainly more experience then I be with the ugly side of life but still a kid who say dumb shit sometimes",
          "I think in this episode like the first one the focus will be on rue",
          "well it be sean bean",
          "that be sean bean though he have to die",
          "what if she really do die in the od",
          "zendaya be so subtly hilarious with her quirk to I love it great comparison",
          "and I swear to god if she be fuck that show",
          "while rue definitely do not have plot armour I just would not see they kill she off in one season maybe in a future season though",
          "oh really be that in the trailer I do not see it",
          "where do you read about it be base around her death",
          "she say when she be in the hospital she pretend the beeping of machine be bird maybe it be a hint that she be not dead and in the hospital",
          "when she first do another character backstory she lead it off with \" sometimes when I be really high I think I be psychic \" which could just be a little tip off that all of these thing be just stuff that she asume and make up to fil in the crack of whatever story she be tell",
          "mom I think",
          "yeah that scene at the carnival seem so random like I never expect her sister to even care about that let alone talk lol",
          "yes I agree with this though I feel every episode do focus on one character like how last one focus on maddie maybe we will see more in depth of rue and her past maybe that be just the plot though",
          "also the church scene might have be rue have suicidal thought I think imagine what her funeral would be like I do not think she die of the overdose it feel kind of cheap and I do not think she kill herself at the end I be not sure though",
          "they be dead all along have be the default theory that dumb people gravitate to for decade now it s the only thing they can come up with",
          "and will continue to to end something like that when you have two actor that conect like that would be stupid hunter and zendaya have also say they ship rule and I know they get a good amount of creative input into the show so I be hope they will end up together",
          "I be think the same thing I really like she but feel bad for her her friend seem to put she on the back burner regularly like when they go to the carnival and everyone just ditch her and clearly she be be play second place to her little sister most of her life I would love to see more of she",
          "when have rue be an unreliable narator through this show",
          "kat say in ep that she s tell one of the twin she s go to the police about the video I think she lie about because she think that guy want a young girl",
          "I don t know if I m word this corectly but have rue directly speak about she od to any character have any character reference she od I need to rewatch both episode but I m try to remember if this happen",
          "she be always save someone maybe she will need to be save",
          "rue be the story teler while she s in the story she s not always the focus without she we don t have someone to conect everyone together",
          "I have a feeling that ali be relate to rue maybe an be uncle it s posible ali have hear of rue and her situation through other family member he be try to be a part of rue s life the reason he have not identify himself as a family member be because he doesn t want rue to withold information in fear of intra family gosip and make he seem like he isn t well intend a reach maybe ali reach out to rue specificaly and know she be bulshit ali and rue be one of the few relatively healthy interaction betwen unrelated adult and tenager in the series ali seem to have good intention and be no nonsense about how he talk to rue he do not really inquire about rue s upbringe likely because he already know he be only interested in her present state and her recovery in their first conversation though it be likely he know the sister thing would get to rue ali know about gia as well ali know what kind of pain gia go through feel free to share your thought and to disect my theory I could be wrong this could be a reach but this have be on my mind",
          "I love rue couldn t stand efy",
          "trust I rue be go to wind up be the most necesary person in this entire show she be by far the most important character just wait for it you will see rue be the person tell we this story this be something that I figure be know by now though plus be by far the most relatable character the shit she go through be just so on point that it be scary",
          "fudge wait this be why I like she so much",
          "help I get this straight so this be the shirt rue be wear in her flashback when she be do drug in the pilot in the nd episode when the teacher ask she about her sumer and in the th episode also there be no way that jule could see rue in this shirt right since nothing be an acident in this show I wonder what you guy think about this",
          "rue seem like someone who would make a great lesbro once she get her addiction and mental health issue sort out",
          "dead people say dep shit",
          "it would not be the first time hbo show writer kill off a like able character",
          "I think its inevitably she ll die somewhere down the line aside from it make sense character wise and her nate be most likely to kick the bucket I just don t see zendaya stick around for more than a season or two if there be another which hopefuly by that time the rest of the cast become strong enough to hold it down without the big and arguably good actor I can easily see the story shift from rue to jule fez or even gia s perspective",
          "I think she be a pretty interesting take on efy from skin uk I will be interested to see how she pan out throughout the season",
          "I think she be into rue and be go to help she get clean and have a healthy relationship at the end",
          "definitely some people think it s bizare and totally unrealistic but then other people basically live it there be some specific plot that resonate with I more than other but I also hover on the fringe of some of the other group that be all in I be personally more like jule but I definitely have friend who be full on rue level and other who be totally lexi inocent the clothe they wear to school aren t realistic because of dres code but a lot of the rest of it yeah I could see it",
          "i d say rue be bi pan but only because that s the more likely plot for they to go for",
          "agree I feel like the show have be plant the seed in adition to that when rue be give fentanyl and be protect by fez she see he have a gun and where it be and to think with fez be the season finale character episode yeah",
          "so rue be marlene dietrich for halowen acord to doni but how do marlene dietrich die get this kidney failure so do this mean since rue kidney be damage and she be in the hospital that it might fail she be cry from pain in her kidney and the season end with she like in the icu or something",
          "I do not know there be a trailer that show she be really disapointed when she talk about \" the guy \"",
          "zendaya be awesome the only reason I m watch at this point",
          "also rue mention that whenever she s high she begin to think that she s psychic which lead to I think that she tell these story base on what she have hear and then exagerate they a bit",
          "probably likely because from what I remember no one else be in the room just rue so probably be just a dream sequence halucination",
          "the only reason I think she could make a good narator be because she may be able to have an objective opinion of everyone but that also may not be as fun as having rue tell an unreliable story",
          "well voice over rue be always talk in the past tense so maybe she s sort of do the voice over after all the shit have go down so it s entirely posible that she find out about everything at some point",
          "even though they make that clear afterwards because the scene snap right out show the guy whistle at kat for her attention when it come to rue and shit they should do something to make it more clear or obvious that it s a flashback or a dream sequence",
          "I could see that but she s a step below rue jule and kat in term of significance and a step above roy troy she s kind of free float and I think it matter",
          "what if season will be on east side completely different actor hahahahah",
          "I completely agree I really like she until the last episode the way that she play with rue s feeling be really rude I feel so sorry for rue and the fact that she she do a fake testimony to the police even if she be threaten make I les like she she could have manage the situation in a smart way",
          "I don t feel like the drug use in skin be ever glamorize rue share a few of efy s quality jule remind I a bit of cassie from generation to",
          "hopefuly but why do they have to do he like that in order to get his back story smh",
          "rue amp jule hardly ever bathe they slep in they go to slep amp wake up with gliter still on their face haha I do not know why I point that out",
          "with rue be an unreliable narator and clean for day do you think we ll see her struggle with stay clean and side efect of her quit cold turkey in the next few episode",
          "oh no doubt about that it probably also have something to do with she work with sam before he seem to like she",
          "so rue be narate everything in a past tense and I be think maybe something involve the police be go to go down and she will be ask to share her side of the story basically what we be see I read somewhere that in the original script she kill nate so maybe that happen just a hunch but I want to share",
          "my high school self feel for she so hard",
          "she should have some ace up here sleve to be a narator while so many thing be go on may be season",
          "I would say she be pan",
          "I can not say I initialy see but I will be make those comparison now they both sure do have the confidence when they need to con someone into do something",
          "the outfit though yes but these scene look really grainy and film like in comparison to the other which remind I of the dick pic scene which make I think it be another scene similar to that something in her head or another fake scenario type thing where she be plot some kind of revenge or explain something they have do a few scene like that so far so I do not think it be to much of a stretchbut I could also be way off I have watch this promo to many time try to put the piece together",
          "oh true I also see someone mention it might have be leslie watch the medical team take rue out of the house in a bodybag not rue watch her dad and that leslie s spech might have be at a funeral service for rue",
          "well she be in a hospital but it seem like she get out because she talk to nate outside the school still posible I gues",
          "she mention it in episode the begining when she have on the sunglas and be on the school bus then she start to tell nate s story also in the third episode when she be still on fentanyl she tell kat s story",
          "I think it s go to be one of the theme but not the entire premise",
          "I might just be dumb as a condom full of peble big thing mckay go to a colege frat initiation but be show play for east highland e e e rue say it s but the photo from maddy s investigation say october th e e rue s wear the same shirt during her overdose as when mouse fed her fentanyl in e so how do she get home how many time do rue go to the hospital e she go home from rehab in regular clothe e she have a flashback to go home but this time she s in a hospital gown fez win t let she into his house in e do she overdose twice that year how old be rue she say sumer before junior year but she be bear in she say it s but tell the man at the a meting that she s e e to be honest might be something else I mis but I can t remember anyone get a clue I m lose I know rue say she s an unreliable narator but this be intense",
          "not this hbo version but the original version I do not remember all the detail but I think the article I read say that the israeli show be base around the main character s death but again never fact check that or look into it any far so I could be completely wrong",
          "in real life she be the library girl from oregon state university I only know that because I go to school there lol",
          "narate from death seem like a reachthe original israeli show end with the main character s death so it s not really a reach",
          "I m so glad I m not the only one lol I have this huge atraction towards zendaya xb sometimes I get really confused I don t know if I m in love with rue or jule lol",
          "I like it skin be the oposite rue and efy be pretty similar in my opinion yet in skin we only ever see the good part of efy s drug life the only time they show she in a negative life be when she be in the hospital for psychotic depresion",
          "so usualy every episode end with a song and the song go until the credit stop I notice that after the big musical number during the credit you could hear bird chirp instead of music it sound like what you would typicaly hear in the morning with all of the theory state that rue overdose and have pas away I wonder if this be another subtle nod to that be the case perhaps after relapse she walk outside and then colapse on the street not be find until the morning just a theory though so we have to wait until season two for answer lol",
          "good point I do not think about that like her narating be separate from she as a character",
          "the story be tell by rue and through rue it be not what be actually happen it be how rue see what be happen there be thre side to every story what you think what I think and what actually happen we will find out what actually happen eventualy for now rue bias be our narative if we adjust ourself to her bias we can see the real plot",
          "pretty sure it be a fake eulogy they be renew for s they need the main character to move on with the story because no one else be really build up enough to be the new main fez make it out of next episode seem unlikely though"

          "yeah I be begin to realize that I think it be just an interesting coincidence",
          "notice how I say \" some \" so if you see this post and get tick off you probably should not unles you be one of the people do this even then it be not a big deal it be just smth I would like to adres and talk about go around on this sub I have see a decent amount of \" rule \" shiper some people who acknowledge their ship be a mess but still like they together other a lil bad I be not bulshit you when I have see someone make a post where they say they be more than earthly being or some shit and that even if they be no long together their relationship will still live on in a metaphysical place as someone who do tarot and believe in ocult stuff even this make I laugh I be not try to be harsh like it be col and all but cmon now lol let we come back down to earth a lil bit then there be the people who be a lil les extreme than that like the one who think they will make it through their toxic way and that one day they will be free of this shit and end up together you know this be not the first time I have see people say thing like this about an unhealthy ship and it be just kind of sad to see because you can just sense idealism from the comment and it kind of remind I of when rue be make that spech in na about how she hope ali be not right about she and jule not be together forever people say that they be \" far more \" than their codependency even though that be how their relationship start and that the rot of it and can I just say that people say this as if codependency be a thing that can not exist betwen two people who love each other as if it be a thing they feel force to be in without love and that be it and that be not true even couple who be codependent first start off healthy but later down the road it start go south not even jule and rue be that some people have to acept what ali say and just take note high school be not forever hence the word \" some \" I know most of you all know this I just like refer to this bcus ali foreshadow a lot of rue and jule fate even if it be not happen now most toxic relationship problem start be solve when the two split up but they learn from each other it be ok for toxicity to end and it be okay to move on I do not know how people think that rue can continue on in this relationship when she sek out jule because she be a replacement for the drug she take and I be talk about the people who think they can still be in this relationship and then just get well over time which no they have to have space from each other and I do not say that to mean she just do not care for her but she be the very reason as to why she be off of they right now and that be not good in any way shape or form no matter how you spin it to look good I also just feel really weird when people say they \" need \" each other almost as if they be validate the codependency it be just interesting they do not \" need \" each other what they do need be to sort their own shit out before drag other people into it they can not be in this relationship and function it just be not realistic or logical I feel for they I honestly truly do but they need to break up this relationship be hurt they both and it be to depresing to see especially since we do not even see they do cute couple y thing all we see now be self destruction self destruction and oh look what be that even more self destruction not to say that they do cute couple y thing would make it any well it be just hard to remember why I like the pair when I just see dreary thing even if they do split up and never contact each other again that do not mean it be all for nothing that do not mean their bond be not something special or great it be nothing about that change that you can still view back on a relationship that go sour and still be grateful that you even get to met a person like that that you even get to be apreciate by someone like that I have to stop talk to a guy friend of mine bcus his sarcastic natue and rudenes exhaust I that later be kind of aim at I but even to this day I be so motherfucke proud he get to be a friend of mine since I still think he be one of the col dude I have ever met that be say it be bafle how people forget rue s drug addiction and think that this relationship will not crush she whether it be platonic or romantic I honestly do not know how some of you all think she can \" work through \" this relationship when this relationship be her new addiction if some of you all want she to be her healthy self then she need to let jule go edit since I see that a lot of you all know who mac miler be then I asume you pretty much know he be in a relationship with ariana as a former stan of her I remember the day where he be on her snapchat gof around and how he comfort she throughout the manchester incident she still have to break up with he she even say they have a toxic relationship due to he still use drug you see that be truly a great pair both of two people who support each other through their dark time that relationship will always be valid that relationship will always be meaningful to ariana personally but they still have to go there separate way for the well it be kind of sad since it take I a long time to just stop and acept the fact that they could not be in each other s life anymore but that be the reality of it jule and rue s situation be not just a few thing they can clean relationship where there a few eror to fix be one that have the two people have por comunication one person feel like they be not get enough attention or some harsh word be throw about those be thing that couple or friend can come out of but relationship where the sole reason it even exist be bcus of codependency be really really hard you know it be sad type this out bcus I would want to go on believe they will eventualy have this beautiful relationship where rue do not have to rely on she be sober but yeah",

          "dude be kind of an asclown but holy fuckaroni do rue end his carer big casualty of night I be go to",
          "from a story tell standpoint they seem to be set up rue to have another bad run in with drug if episode be in fact a fezco centric episode why else would they chose to tell his story last it have to be to set up a rue conclusion ultimately there have be discusion about whether fez love rue romanticaly people cite how care free he be about spot rue money why would a drug dealer whose big know motivation be to make money so frely let we rue slide on all the money she owe he it be not because of a romantic interest in rue it be guilt it be guilt for get enable her addiction and guilt for her od and that be what make fezco such an interesting character he be a drug dealer who be tear by his motivation to make money and provide for whomever the bed riden woman be in episode and the consequence of his drug deal on rue s life he play a part in destroy life rue so that he can provide for another life bedriden woman in episode we have see that guilt weigh on he throughout the season from his big brotherly relationship with rue I believe we will see how rue s fate be directly tie to fezco in the episode finale",
          "that be a different discusion but I will entertain it and say that fez be complicit in the same exploitive system that everyone else be and be sell adictive substance to child substance produce by far more exploit worker from overseas if fez do not seem bad than the average worker in legal trade I do not know what to say to change your mind",
          "fez be super cute and I do not want anyone to hurt he especially nate they be poly just good friend",

          "ok we all be upset about fez I m place a bet that this season end with rue kicking nate ass in prison like who the fuck be go to take care of fox s mom",
          "I do not consider jule cheat because technicaly she and rue be not even together it be complicated I do not get those vibe from fez I think he genuinely care for rue though it be a little sister big brother type of relationship with they two he be show he be wiling to protect she all he can from mouse and refuse to give sell her drug even when she insult and tell he she hate he I love their relationship and I hope nothing happen to fez",

          "fez seem like a genuinely great person in term of the character I think it s important to realize that he will not take any of what rue be say to heart I m sure he s hear plenty of addict and tweaker say thing they don t really mean in the heat of their drug fuel pasion rage I also don t believe rue will harbor any sort of true resentment towards fez maybe at first but she will realize he be do the ultimate good thing",
          "fez steal money from a doctor and plan on use it to give to mouse cassie have an abortion",
          "if they kill he off I will be ruin",

          "honestly he s one of my favorite character he s a good friend to rue deal to take care of his family and have moral he have every right to sell the drug to rue when she beg himbut he do not because he know how bad of a place she be in and compare to nate he s a saint",
          "all the dealer I ve know would go wild about that it certainly wouldn t be ignore bring to much attention",
          "fez just try to survive there ya go",
          "right if anything happen to he I ll die I love he and he must be protect at all cost",

          "I be not entirely sure but the guy that fez walk over to be they the twin nice detail if so",
          "fez and rue be easily my favorite",
          "that be a tough scene to watch I be happy he do not give in to rue",
          "or maybe like kep in the back of this head not like jump both foot in he also kep go once nate start insinuate that fez be a drug dealer",
          "z must have enjoy the shit out of make this episode so many side of she in one ep",
          "fez have some heart",
          "I do not know I mean he do not take all of that guy money he take what he need to pay mouse for the drug he have to dump I think he just have to sell because he have to support his family and pay for his grandma s medical care the show have not really suply enough information for we to conclude fez be deal because he be addict to it so I hope we get more of his character in season two so long as he be still around",
          "he look similar to mac miler and it make I a whole other level of sad when I watch this show it be all to real",
          "in episode when rue s mom be make she take a drug test after rue get the pe from lexi her mom mention how dificult it be for everyone after she od d and talk about how it be especially hard for her young sister to find she die on the flor then they show a glimpse of the od scene later at that party fez tell she how he didn t like see she go through all that stuff and it definitely seem like he s talk about her overdose but doesn t flat out say it so I m asume at least he know about it",
          "I could have mis something but with all of the time rue have get drug from fez so far I have not see her pay even during the whole mouse situation she go over specificaly for drug but when mouse be try to get she to pay for the fentanyl she only have I do not get it do any of you",
          "I mean his refusal to sell to she be clearly out of empathy and love and not frustration that she be not pay",
          "we get a post like this every couple of day and people always defend he because he s a fan favorite but there s really no excuse he could sell these drug to adult but he chose to target tenager he s not an evil person like nate but he s far from be the decent guy people think he be",
          "so rue would not have become a drug addict if it be not for fez it sound like you be put all the blame on fez and none on the she be go to be an addict regardles of if fez be around that be not how life or addiction work rue be responsible for her action not fez you be take one aspect of his life and say that be what define he as a person if you think someone sell drug automaticaly make they a bad person you need to met more people as far as ashtray I agree he be to young to be involve I do not think we have enough information to put that on fez right now I think most viewer have piece together that fez and ashtray be sell drug to take care of a family member medical bil or their parent could be force they we do not know the full story yet",
          "while I don t agree with fez sell drug I don t think he s a piece of shit we ve see that he have limit to what he do and it seem like he s sek drug for a purpose not just for money and I don t blame rue drug addiction on he at all she start abuse drug before he start sell to she",
          "that be the thing from what we have see he be a decent guy people can point out his flaw because all the character have some I be refer to the fact that when someone say \" I like love fez \" people be quick to comment that be he be a bad guy because he sell drug which just be not factual for the show or real life",
          "that be what I be sayin I have be think it be ashtray and especially with this new episode where they randomly get ashtray because the mom give he up",
          "I m hope we ll get a backstory on fez",
          "the weapon can be plier and a blow torch",
          "seem like you be a big mac fan you even know about his producer nickname be which be col asf",
          "where be you get that he target tenager we have see he sell to rue but he be never say he exclusively sell to teen I be also under the impresion that he be a teen himself so he be not an adult \" target \" teen he be a teen selling to his per I be also not argue with you that sell drug be bad wrong I be just say that sell drug do not automaticaly mean you be a shit person",
          "yeah and that be the last time we ever see he like that but I do apreciate how they take a different path with his character instead of the usual stereotype dumb jock not all jock be dumb we just get extra lucky with a psychotic one",
          "that be just what discogolfjohny be say and really most of the other post I have see about fez to he be a complex character not a saint sure he be col to rue but he sell drug to kid he be a moraly grey person people be just try to kep it in perspective",
          "I want to see the little banger brother shot mouse head off when he be rub up rue leg",
          "I think fez s addiction be to feel like he s an infalible protector for those he care about though we don t know all the detail I think it s fair to say he s a very recently grow up parentalized child he feel like he have to provide for and look out for everybody ashtray his grandmother rue anyone who s important to rue who seem at risk I think it s safe to asume he start sell drug not because he have some fantasy about be a high roler but because it be the only way he could think of to provide for his family when we met he for the first time he s invest in how he can be a support system for rue and be far to easily persuade to give she what she want in the moment his decision to threaten nate and target mouse s drug conect be pretty stupid from a self preservation standpoint but that s not what he s interested in he almost seem incapable of think about what s in his and by extension his love one s self interest in the long term because he s so concerned about protect they from what seem like the most imediate and acesible threat I really really really hope he s ok next season and his character arc will involve learn that he have to take well care of himself to well care of the people he love",
          "ugh I feel so uncomfortable for he during that drug dealer scene last night he be a true ride or die friend",
          "fez literally say she be like family",
          "this post be dumb but I ve see dumb post in this sub anyway so do you all think fez be asexual he never show any interest in anyone and whenever someone mouse nate ask he if rue be his bitch gf etc he get kind of weride out and he s like nah it s never like that I mean this be just I theory I love fez no matter what but would love some asexual rep",
          "they be the pic of fezco in his grandmother s room when rue be there look like an old version of the same kid on his lap look maybe he s just short but no one seem to know who he be",
          "man I feel bad for fez the most he drop out of school to take care of his sick mom from the look of it she be a single mother and the only source of income no way he can aford to pay for her medical bil either so he sell drug its tragic",
          "he really do not come off as someone push people to do anything ashtray a little but he be a kid so you can not blame he to much",
          "walt be a bad person who have a way out every step of the way fez clearly doesn t have that same luxury and be try to do the right thing here",
          "you be right I go to far but I do not think he be the saint everyone think he be",
          "chop and screw version",
          "for some dumb reason I think she be go to call the police on fez for a few second",
          "I agree with you on the point that people be responsible for the action but kid be impresionable and you have a position in the power dynamic of adult to child and suplier to buyer you have a responsibility to yourself your comunity and to the vulnerable to do the right thing and turn they away",
          "it be way out of character for fez to say that on a whim weird that the writer make he say that but ya know they need the drama I gues",
          "um duh that be pretty much a give do fez have a thing for rue I think so but still",
          "woah he be far from a piece of shit",
          "yeah he kep it so understate but it be more intense the way he react so deciduously kep it calm in all situation even when its obvious where his fear level be he trust his judgment and hang in this be the guy first act role",
          "oh my bad in that case I still feel like a no fez really do not seem like he want to be to deply involve in the life of any of these kid bar rue I suppose fez and ashtray seem to business orient for that honestly",
          "I agree he be not a sound individual I could see he do something horible",
          "I can only hope he just beat he up and didn t kill he because I really don t think mouse be go to be forgive about fez screw he up like this",
          "if fezco die I be burn hbo headquarters down he and lexi be the only pure character and I love they",
          "not just a rich dr that be mouse s conect fez folow he there",
          "he also know that rue isn t ready for recovery if he doesn t help she she ll find someone else who definitely win t give a fuck about she his refusal to sell fent even after he be force to pay double for it make he stand out as the one character so far who s draw a line and stand by it",
          "fez be live by survival sure what he be do be not ideal and he probably feel remorse for it but I believe decent character can do not so decent action",
          "I just want to give fez a big big hug right now",
          "I feel like he really view she as his little sister someone he have to look over because she almost die at the hand of the drug he sell she like he state I also feel like he care soo much for she that he be probably go to ice she out in the next episode hence why rue be bang on his dor with no response it be probably in his good interest to just cut she off completely which also might send rue into a cold turkey depresion kind of situation because he be she go to dealer",
          "I could be mistaken but I think that guy give she his number I gues fez could have take it",
          "pretty sure rue say ashtray be",
          "he be definitely more like than dislike I be refer solely to the people who be comment under fez apreciation post say \" but he be a drug dealer \"",
          "he literally call she his little sister in episode",
          "I do not believe that because you be a drug dealer automaticaly make you a bad person I also know recover acident be tell to acept responsibility for their addiction rue be go to become an addict regardles of who sell what to her sure you can say fez her upbringe her father pas and a handful of other thing influence she into try drug at the end of the day it be still her choice unles fez force the drug down her throat he be not responsible for her addiction I agree with you that character on a show and people in real life be not just good or just bad my argument be that fez from what we know so far be a sect guy also that be a drug dealer do not automaticaly mean you can not be a good or decent person",
          "let we just hope mouse do not try to get ahold of her jez that scene have I nervous",
          "I can not get over the ' rule ' tato they get whiskey tango foxtrot",
          "I think rue only draw the line because fez draw the line if it be present to she by fez I doubt she d turn it down",
          "funny you mention this as I just rewatche episode and think the exact same regard the couch conversation also when fez say I m to high to be have this conversation right now really remind I of his song conversation part off swim just a lot of similarity there that be hard to ignore esp as a big mac fan",
          "I think fez be close to age with everyone it seem that people know he and his little brother on a pretty friendly level you don t usualy have that with you be drug dealer",
          "the way she talk to fez last episode be god awful and make I hate she alitle more I def think it s a brother sister vibe because if he be just a dealer then he would have say screw she and fed she the drug and if he be in love with she he would have break down and either give she some or atleast have open the dor that be def sible tough love kind of stuff hell he think about kilin a gang afiliate dealer for she to protect she",
          "oh I m not try to make excuse what he do be terible I m just say I can understand why he do what he do doesn t mean I m col with it",
          "I literally just have this exact thought about eps if they folow the same patern and focus on character s backstory to start the episode fez s arc most likely end with he sell again to rue and be an instrument in her suicide or od",
          "almost every post that someone comment and say they love fez someone be comment under they complain about the love fez be get yes deal drug be moraly frown upon most if not all of we can agree that sell drug to minor be wrong that be say say fez be just a criminal shity person or the bad character on the show seem a little excesive he might not be the most moraly corect character but he be not the most moraly corupt character either he might be a drug dealer but he be already prove to be more moraly righteous than a lot of character on the show he defend rue against mouse and pay to avoid she be rape he do not hold rue action against her and he refuse to sell her drug after the mouse incident the drug dealer I know would sell I crack if I be nine month pregnant if it make they a profit from what we have see so far fez be a decent guy he be not out hear blackmailing girl or banging mary I the you should not like fez because he be a drug dealer narative be play out",
          "seriously I be read this like wow that predict fezs whole episode",
          "so far fez have pay twice for rue and she have not pay it back yet",
          "isn t fez like and adult and rue a minor",
          "I gain a lot of respect for a character I figure be go to be kind of a throw away you know just the drug dealer rue go to every now and again but the way angus play the scene and fez do for rue really flesh he out a great deal",
          "protect fez at all cost",
          "it really break my heart watch that scene where rue and fez talk on the couch at mckay s party \" you still go to be my dealer fez \" see fez ' face and the way he talk it obviously remind I of mac s situation and make the scene hurt even more it be like I be hear mac speak to himself before he die do not know if that make sense but when he be talk to rue it be as if rue be his own self when he tell she he be not go to be her dealer anymore because he do not want she to od rue be mac he be tell that to himself I do not know I kep watch that episode over and over again at the end fez say \" you be a trip bruh \" and that be exactly how it feel rip lary fisherman",
          "I agree kind of she be just there and if she do not end up a thing with rue she be just a friend kind of exist we need a fez episode man",
          "I love fez so much he care about rue a lot and it break my heart that she can not see that in the first episode he say that he be see a lot of people die but none like she and ugh I just love his character so much he be so pure and he be a genuine person",
          "or kill her lol walt be may more fuck up than fez apear to be",
          "rue go back to fez for drug but this time it get he kill by mouse it really mess rue up and she blame herself and spiral",
          "didn t he have both he dip that blade in powder and stick it in rue s mouth irc",
          "yeah fezco hold it down he do the right thing kep a straight face ofer to take care of everything and didn t raise his voice damn that scene be intense I love a show that make I nervous xb I be mad rue for barge in there and act like that her character pis I off at the moment but it s suppose to be that way",
          "well I would not say that everything we know about he be good because he sell hard narcotic to tenager so he be not a saint but other than that he seem nice",
          "I think rue be go to get fez to fight nate but because favorite character always die fez be go to get yete out of existence I hope I m wrong though I love fez",
          "a guy give up money for a girl can be show feeling do you forget the world we live in but either way it wasn t about the money it be more about he pay so she would not have to get fuck for drug she didn t even want in the first place I could be wrong though",
          "I could be wrong but I really think fez be in love with rue",
          "I think I be trip until she say brother mouzone fucker done pul a fast one",
          "to I it look like he just lift up her short and slide they in because she be blitz plus they flush they after mouse leave",
          "at least we can see that he care about rue s welbeing and apear to be someone rue can go to talk to and open up with besides jule",
          "fezco and ashtray be my favorite character after rue and jule I be think there be more to fez than just be a dropout who sell drug when we see that sick elderly woman in his apartment it make I think that maybe he have no other choice than to sell drug to pay for her medical bil and provide for ashtray",
          "she already get a flashback though and they have flashback per episode for different character fezco maybe",
          "no mention of fez and how that one got put off to for no reason",
          "in all fairnes he do do this to rue he probably introduce she to drug and many other kid all to save his mum s life what make her life more valuable than the life of other",
          "the way that fez handle that situation be some of the good television I ve see in a while he be in a real rock and a hard place scenario and handele it adeptly he seem a dulard and maybe a bit of a space case but he have his intuiton for that character to stick his neck out when it could have be very costly and side with protect rue be a great chunk of character devolpment in a short time span",
          "could not agree more I love fez however he do not have to go out and threaten this dude just because he can because he be a drug dealer",
          "I don t think this add up fez be old then the main character he would have to be the old brother and there would no indication os how ashtray end up with he I think fez lose his parent young and be raise by his grandma but then she start to get sick and he have to start take care of she and his young brother pay the bil and shit that s how he end where he be and eventualy ashtray be wicked smart as he be want to help as well the main character will have their episode and although their story intertwind I think that the main event that define their arc be independent from each other",
          "you could tell from he check that the gun be still betwen the cushion that he wouldn t have hesitate blasting mouse if it get to the point where mouse actually start asault rue",
          "ashtray",
          "not say what he do be right I totally disagre with what he do all I m say be I can see why he do what he do even though it s be a shity thing to do so while I m disapointed in he I do t hate he or see how he s bad than the douche twin who post kat s sextape online",
          "I think that be a good point and buying from fez be probably safe as well I think you be right he be a survivor rather than a saint or piece of shit",
          "I look on imdb and brynda matox be list as fezco s grandma so I think that s who it be those two kid be on their own pretty much",
          "fez definitely remind I of a few people",

          "their name and the fez tybalt relation be both really good point",
          "yeah and I do not think it be a coincidence he tell mouse she be his lil sis that be his go to relation to she because that be really how he think of she",
          "I honestly think fezco be the good character on the show we do not know very much about he but everything we do know be good he take care of a sick relative he care for rue and even try to protect kat he will not sell to someone base on moral and let we not forget he do not human trafic as interesting as a maddie cassie lexi backstory may be I think his would be much well",
          "when you re actively help tenager become adicted to drug you re not a decent person that s not how it work just because he have a soft spot for rue and decide to stop sell it to her doesn t mean he s not enable several other kid in the same situation the only diference be he doesn t care about they not to mention the fact that he have ashtray who be even young than the teen he sell drug to as his partner absolutely nothing about this behavior be decent",
          "walt would have give she the drug to shut she up",
          "doesn t fez sell the girl the ticket for the moly he s ashtray s frontman even at the gas station ashtray be out of sight do the business but fez be up front vet the customer he s work at another stand the girl ask he for moly he tell they she s work over at the pretzel stand and give they the smiley face ticket that let we ashtray know they re good to sell to",
          "fez see rue as his lil sister or at least that be how I see it",
          "I asume either his mom or grandma that raise he which be why his little brother just want to stack this money and pay off my mortgage",
          "no I do not want anything to happen to he he literally seem like he have this genuine heart and he just want the good for rue",
          "also likely why he drop out of high school pedle drug be the only way he can kep a rof over his head",
          "bruh that s ashtray",
          "face tato be really it curious how fez would have let that happen to his brother",

          "when you be in survival mode you have to chose betwen you survive or help the next person get by be at the botom do this to you trust I I know from experience it be not always ethical but whatever it take especially when family be involve sell to kid be probably the reason why fez be so sucesful no little kid want to go to an old crepy man mouse for example and buy something they might not even be educate about plus I would imagine his clientele be crazy and would work more with kid than adult because everyone in the school buy from he and spread the word around to other teen get to get it by any mean most the time when you start live well and actually start come out of survival mode then you have a choice and moral kick in again at that point t I gues it be just a personal decision",
          "maybe it get he out though take out the dealer dealer I do not think he want to be a dealer at all but he be take care of his grandma either that or mouse kill fez after he figure it out if he figure it out",
          "do anyone else ship frezco and rue I genuinely feel like he love she in a way that jule could never he protect she and want what be good for her to the point that he be wiling to give up a client which be hard for most dealer I feel like if rue really give he a chance they would be great together",

          "nah they \" more than friend \" they just do not know it yet or maybe fezco have other priority like his grandma to take of before he can get with rue",
          "fez be a solid dude that entire exchange at the dor neither be right and neither be wrong I really see their relationship as big brother little sister nothing more rue be a genuinely interesting and good person she just can t see past it because she s a kid and an addict sell drug be probably the only life fez know and whatever his reason for do it be be that lifestyle come with consequence whether he can continue to live with they be up to he",
          "pretty fiercely contest his protector stance",

          "this have get to be my favorite episode so far other than the part where cassie get pregnant and nate be a little bitch with fez I have to say there isn t much in term of plot progresion but holy moly if that wasn t the good episode I ve see some be thought rue and jule do not interact face to face once this episode and yet the entire time they be apart they talk and think about each other in a way we still feel like they re conect and they re go through a lot individualy try to figure thing out this be really hard to achieve two protagonist be apart the whole episode and make it still feel engage and like they re conect and I think the writer do such a great job on this I m so proud of my girl rue for be able to stay away from drug even when she s at her low state all season love the detective scene so much also zendaya in suspender get I feel some type of way act wise zendaya be kill it the way the writer depict depresion and rue s manic and depresive state be so spot on a classic example of show and not tell and yet it didn t feel depresing or like they be try to hard it really feel like we be be take on a journey through rue s mind seriously though how do they make an episode about depresion so damn entertaining be the love island thing a nod to tom holand by any chance he be always talk about love island in his spider man interview but I m probably reach I be so glad to see the scene where maddy and kat be call each other out on their respective bulshit it feel meta in some way like the writer know we would notice both of they be hypocrite and screw up and be use both character to call each other out I love that scene they be both be colosal bitch to each other but they really do have a point jule casualy talk about transition be probably the first time transgender ness have be talk about on television in such a casual way so as to be a very normal thing and I be live for it I be odly happy when I see jule and her friend run up the stair in the apartment building and be in the car it seem like jule really enjoy be back in the city again where she spend most of her life grow up I m glad she get to experience new thing when she be high at the club with that girl hanah or ana or something I just wish it would ve be under well circumstance and not when she be so emotionaly vulnerable fez be so badas betwen he and nate despite all the high horse shit he be spew at fez for be a dropout drug dealer I have more respect for fez than I ever will for nate you can really tell he care about rue because he really didn t have to put himself on the line like that but he do I wasn t to excited to watch cassie s story but the intro actually make I sympathize so much more for her I get to say I fear for she in episode I think she go through so much this episode and I hope she doesn t end up kill herself or anything like that because the whole time I think it would lead to that rue and jule be go to be fine guy as friend or partner they will be fine I have faith in they they ve both show character growth especially rue so proud of her ugh as for jule I think she s learn more about herself and what she like and doesn t like and I think she ll have it more figured out by the time she met rue again",
          "I think it be a good episode but I think the problem be that episode seem like they be build up for a dramatic season finale that never really happen I blame it on they write not know if they be go to have a season so they extend some of the plotline that would have be resolve in tonight s episode it be not a bad episode but it be not what I be expect really excited for season though",
          "right I do not even see a similarity betwen degrasi and this show besides the issue the way they play out the episode with one character get the main focus be not even similar to degrasi but similar to skin so I could see where they could use that like you say",

          "amazing scene it simultaneously give the nate jule shiper something to chew on while also remind they how toxic any kind of relationship betwen they would be it also be a perfect encapsulation of all the conflicted feeling jule have and of course the visual and music be fantastic",

          "yeah this be basically my feeling the finale be good but it feel like a bait and switch they kep ratchet up this tension with all the various secret twist strongly imply that it would all come to a head and then it just like never do it kind of cheapen all the work they do early in the season I be go to",
          "yes and in general sometimes the volume seem to go up and down I have to turn up my tv super loud",

          "I m a huge movie buf and I enjoy discover new show like this one that I just so happen to randomly stumble upon I really like the camera work that be display in every episode the cinematography be great and I love the transition some shot leave I scratch my head which be a good thing like how do they do that shot the carnival episode se be a prime example of what I m talk about watch the camera go from the ground to a bird s eye view over the feris whel then back to a close up shot of a character walk through the crowd be really good to I I know that most people could care les about stuff like this but I pay attention these kind of thing and I apreciate they more than your average audience member like the scene in the pilot episode when the room slowly turn upside down a full after rue walk out of the bathrom and the drug start to kick in that be fucking dope anyway I think I ve make my point so",
          "I have be think lately about how shiping culture have become a really big thing over the year it seem with almost every show people have a favourite couple they want to see as endgame the reason I have be think about it in when look at discusion about this show be because euphoria seem like a show where the character be not mean to be ship except maybe kat and ethan it just seem that because of the character disposition any relationship with they in it will ultimately end up fail and will not become end game take rue for example if you look at the main character rue have be ship with I e jule lexi and fez while they be great people I can envision they end up badly we know why with jule but with lexi I think because of the way they portray she as be a dependable friend and the fact that she have not receive much character development it seem to I that a rexi relationship would basically be rue be dependent lexi and not really care about lexi to the full with rue and fez his profesion may lead to conflict betwen they because while fez may care about rue enough to not sell her drug he still need to sell drug to make money if we asume it be to help a sick relative I be not write this post to dump on anyone s ship and I really do think that most people s ship be just harmles fun I lowkey ship rue and lexi despite everything I have just say I just like to analyse theme and plot in every show I watch lol also what I love about this show be it be realistic aproach to relationship and even if you ship certain character you can not help but analyse the dynamic of their relationship and question whether it be healthy or not this show be refreshing in this aspect because I have be see a patern these day where a show where a show relationship pair that wind up be end game and these pairing be so unrealistic and sometimes toxic but be do for fan service and do not really question the fan idea of what a healthy relationship be ps sorry if this be badly write or do not make sense I be write this in stream of consciousnes",
          "yeah I remember he say that to I don t see why someone would randomly mention that a specific drug be pop off in tampa florida if that be not where they be at also when people from other state think of florida they do not typicaly think of tampa they think of miami orlando talahase plus I grow up and live in the ft lauderdale area most of my life and I could see this be in florida",
          "this would have be right up there with get for bad hbo series finalesit be artsy and open end it wasn t a catastrophic gigle induce colapse of characterization world building and the basic tenet of write",

          "first episode rue join jule get home and she shuder in front of the miror when jule get undresed chuckle maliciously that s the moment in my opinion",
          "I don t know that I think the writing on euphoria be strong in general it s fine it s fit for purpose it s not the strength of the show and I don t think it ever try to be show like the wire or deadwod rely far more on write for obvious reason euphoria apear mean first and foremost to be a largely sensory emotive experience and I don t think the finale be a letdown in that respect although ep be still the pinacle divisive be a fair descriptor but divisive doesn t necesarily mean bad it can mean chalenge I m genuinely surprising at the people clamor for closure as close any of their arc series finale or not would have be disingenuous in regard to the story they be tell particularly rue as addiction be a batle she would realisticaly be fight her entire life she be head for relapse from the moment her sobriety ocur and the show be boldly underscore that inevitability at every turn it s not about drug be bad so much as it s about the way drug trip be portray on this show do not represent the reality of her situation good or bad I feel like you d need to divorce that sequence from the context of the show it be take place in to arive at the conclusion that it be glamorize drug use though personally I don t find euphoria glamorize anything in the same way I didn t feel trainspoting or requiem for a dream glamorize anything and often go almost comicaly overboard in the other direction the show have be very very frank in its depiction of the cost of rue s addiction both to she personally and to those around her no matter how lavishly present a relapse be always go to be tragic that s one of the thing the show do so beautifuly it dovetail moment of intense poignant tragedy with glorious mesmerize spectacle if we be talk about this be a series finale it wouldn t just be an open end series finale it d be a series finale more dependent on its abruptnes than tony soprano be cut off in the midle of a sentencewhich be also a fantastic finale and I ll fight anyone who claim it wasn t pnot every end need to be six foot under and give you closure for the next year there s a lot of different way to come at these thing if you re disapoint that s fine enjoyment of medium be a subjective exercise but for pity s sake don t compare it to fucking game of throne that show turn into a completely risible joke and it s be getting dunk on in popular culture circle far and wide this just would have be a show that could really have use another season to fully tell its character s story but never get they",
          "you re definitely not the only one this show s ripe for shiper even though it even just kind of tear they a new one in the last episode to but rue s get a lot to work on and magical sexual orientation change be another problematic part of television that I would think a show like euphoria would take great length to avoid especially when rue learning to acept jule as a friend would be a key component of her growth as a character as learn to acept compromise as not only necesary but a great potential within itself be a large part of overcome addiction",
          "she come from the burb so I asume la shit look sketchy though and hipster so maybe san francisco",
          "with depsite the situation I love everything about that moment you can tell zendaya s character wasn t fully coherent and still come off the substance amazing act the car scene could have easily be that awkward ride home and start out that way but as you continue to watch you could feel the dynamic change with everything go with that family their bond seize that moment smilingthroughtear",
          "people usualy want closure with their finale but one thing this show do be really try to reflect and examine real life theme and in real life there be not much closure",
          "fairly certain the first one with the girl in the car be the megan the stalion song not sure about the other one though",

          "euphoria have some of the good music choice for a television show curently on air both song selection and the ost what be some of your favourite use of the music on the show hold up great choice to end the cold opening on right after we learn how rue become addict and her own melancholic childhod work the jule nate texting scene that compliment some intricate cinematography goh the cherleader s dance music at the pep rally I know there s go to be good time the iconic rotate halway trip release the hound easily mis song it play in the background when maddy tell nate she black out",

          "yet I think they do that on purpose I mean next episode be the finale afteral",
          "completely agree I ve also notice an overal similarity betwen euphoria and the catcher in the rye with holden and rue both be present as unreliable narator as they both narate each of their respective story and be both show as not extremely reliable people and also in season episode they re be a direct comparison of the scene where nate father met with his guy friend in the motel room and ask just to talk instead of what be originaly intend to when holden have a prostitute suny send to his hotel room and instead ask to just talk with she because he be lonely and depresed and doesn t intend to do anything else with her find it rather interesting that I couldn t find anything else on the internet about the clear comparison betwen these two piece",

          "I hope so I need this show",
          "where do you read the original script",
          "so I have see a lot of people compare this show to skin and I be think what if they be folow the same format as skin by change the cast every season plus if it be folow the original euphoria and rue die they could kill she off by the end of the second season and the rd season would focus on gia more grown up and her group of friend clasmate",
          "I feel exactly the same I be in love with carnival ep but I feel emotion per second during this one I have to admit it be the top one",

          "sorry where be we get this thing that jule tell rue she want to live with her I feel like we be mis an important piece of narative here rue be get more and more adicted to jule and we can tell that in her ever change story with that thing which be why I think it kep come up for example in episode one rue say that jule tell she that when be a kid she want to live with a good friend she have not met yet but she know they would get along then in another episode she admit that jule probably should not have say that to her then last episode rue fully insert herself for the first time in that fantasy now she be say that they even talk about it which be complete bulshit she just can not admit to herself that she be obses with jule I think jule be clearly go through a lot weirdly enough I feel the most related to her character I be not white not tran not even american yet I feel like I have similar experience the last image on this episode be so heartbreaking for I because I can completely relate to her feel like the weight of the world be on your shoulder have to cary not only herself but someone else entirely publicly she who can not say no let we just kep in perspective that rue be not reliable she be an addict and a liar and jule be only human to also this be not what she want she just want a calm life with a good friend but honestly there be not such thing with addict no one ever want that",
          "I think there be a reason ali her \" coach \" I can not think of the another word kind of warm rue about jule in general I think people who be just recover from addiction be always discourage from start new relationship because it can take they off their journey to stay clean look back that scene in episode I think where jule ride off on her bike leave rue by herself and the previous suny sky turn cloudy and begin to rain be foreshadow I always feel like it be but ali s word plus the preview for the next episode kind of confirm this where someone be question if jule even really like rue in the way that she want I be nervous that rue be codependent on jule and if jule do not reciprocate feeling or something happen to their relationship the literal cloud and rain will come back into rue s life we already see how quick rue be to turn back to drug the second jule be not around she for a couple hour",
          "yeah for sure this be always a tricky thing that can potentialy ruin friendship doesn t even have to be explosive but the platonic magic just stop and people slowly drift apart this one thing jule say when rue ask like I I or like he I she reply with either and a smile to I this be still not intentionaly lead she on but it do mean she s be playful still not uncomon betwen good friend and like we jule also doesn t know enough about rue in the short time they ve know eachother to realize she s potentialy into her girl",
          "jule have an entire episode dedicate to she and her back story air this sunday how be that discriminatory either way euphoria be base on rue benet and her life jule be overshadow by rue because it s rue s story she be the star of the show jule be a character rue curently find interest in if jule character arc be to end or change euphoria would still go on because it s rue s story no matter how unlikable you find she",
          "she be absolutely on love with rue",
          "do you mean jule he definitely know he be texte she because she send he those nude rue tok and her face be in those",
          "jule seem into she before they go to the club but yeah once she get high she start think about rue and she be the one who break the kis by the time they be make out and have sex she be completely out of her mind the girl have her eye on the prize she already know who jule be before she even introduce herself so I think she have every intention of hok up with she that night so it do feel like she take advantage of she a little bit",
          "I do not know dude the way rue be act re jule all episode be build to that the question be whether it s legitimate love or she s just latch onto jule in response to the lack of drug",
          "I think the kis betwen rue and jule in episode be towards the end or maybe the midle in one of the preview jule be see with she make up and mascara run down her face with the wing in the back her hair look wet to that have to be after the pol scene and after we see they walk down the street in the trailer for next week also if they do break up next week they will probably reconcile pretty soon because they go to this dance together which be see from one of the trailer and they look pretty happy I think that be from episode th the finale there be also this scene where they be bike from that same dance episode",
          "yes it do feel to I like she take advantage of jule ' vulnerability but jule also use she as \" pacifi \" for sad sex so they kind of use each other it may feel like the girl from the nightclub benefit more but that girl be def just a tol for jule",
          "aside for jule not really be the good person for rue I feel bad about how many people have tell she that they will not work out even though her mom show full support that guy from the addict support group and nate have tell she the same thing jule do not like you and will forget about you like they be both make it rue s fault for get so atached",
          "honestly the trailer make I think rue and jule would get together so come into the show I think they d be a thing it wasn t until I start watch that it become obvious it be one side",
          "jule be suppose to ask rue if she s ever be in love next episode I imagine rue look back on her previous experience and we get that scene",
          "agree I would rather they be friend I just hope instead of turn to drug that she will reach out to ali for pancake again lol",
          "I think rue will get high and kill jule I know it be far fetched but wow that would be something",
          "that be exactly what I think to she do not know how to deal with this relationship she have with her I think she still have dank feeling though because she even list jule on one of the reason why she go sober",
          "rue and jule be make out this will end up so badly I be scared",
          "ya like I say not everyone feel that way but as far as tie and jule I couldn t agree more sadly I don t think it be go to last like reu want it to",
          "yeah I know what you mean I think jule not be open with her dad could be that she be never be in a relationship before so this be definitely new to she and she be still figure it out where as rue be all open and about it lol as for ali s conversation with rue he be right rue have to get clean for herself not for someone else and the soon she realize that the well her relationship will be in a way it be not fair the presure she be put on jule here be to hope that gets clear up soon where do you read up on theory high key interested in read they as well",
          "now I be read a few review about the show when I come a cros this one it s a very detailed review about the first episode it get everything right so far and it also confirm some stuff about rue and jule don t read it if you don t want the first episode spoil here s the link",
          "very true for all we know rue ain t even into dick",
          "I hope we see more of that in s cuz right now I do not really like jule that much I mean I love her character but she be act real unusual",
          "the only thing they have in comon be how guard they be with mj she bring she guard down a little when she realise how much peter care for her and with rue she do the same with jule diference be mj be more emotionaly strong and independent than rue and I m say this because there s be hint about mj s background of not have a great home life so she s learn how to look after herself and be strong example the mace and also how she have a way with scare people off with her word rue on the other hand always need to rely on something to support herself first it be the drug now jule",
          "rue be a virgo she be literally bear day after be you say these be your prediction",
          "but be not that before she kis rue again I to believe jule be not in love with she but still",
          "I think platonic she s jealous that rue be spend all her time with jule n no time with she",
          "in the end when she kis peter I be like it be like jule and rue",
          "nah do not bug yourself about it loledit I do not really care about people want rule to be a couple that be col those character be col but it kind of get tiring when ask they how do they know jule like rue and they have nothing to back it up with",
          "not much you can do all you can do be see that it be not you be fault she should not be force to take care of someone you can see jule be not ready for something like that but rue become to atach",
          "jule be go to distance herself from rue out of fear of be the reason behind her sobriety she be start to do hang with reckles people to cop with she be stres out she go to a party I asume with some new people in one of the trailer and stand in a car go through a tunel in another which I asume be in the same episode probably I do not think that be go to end well and she come back to town hurt in some way and run back to rue",
          "from the moment I see jule ride her bike I know I be go to be with this show for a while",
          "they be in a codependent relationship but that do not mean that jule could not have consider rue s feeling and situation she literally tell rue not to wory about leave her medication after rue sufer a life endanger depresive episode she absolutely could have go about thing well I still do not hate the character but right now I be not a big fan",
          "I think that jule feel a lot of presure since she s the reason rue be stay clean and be stres that she could potentialy screw rue recovery up however I can see where jule could be straight the date app cal and tyler I hope that jule realize how much rue truly love she and she doesn t run away or that they at least figure out where they stand",
          "I don t know if they actually know who each other be because face don t seem to be show in the quick photo that be show when jule be do a swipe through",
          "rue be into her unlike the other young woman portray in the show rue s sexual history be leave blank it be go to be center on jule and jule like guy",
          "to answer your question jule say she didn t top to one of her grindr hok up I gues like you say we still don t know what jule s preference would be especially if this be her first relationship with a girl we don t even know how rue identifie either and if she would be wiling to be top in the conventional way or even go down on jule",
          "don t really think jule be lead she on at all to be honest at least not intentionaly pretty comon for girl bf to lay up with each other and say I love you we see rue do the same with her sister",
          "anyone else feel icky about that kind of like the girl take advantage of jule she get jule really high and then when jule want to text rue the girl say she should not then when jule do kis she she say \" only one more kis \" the whole time they be together all jule be think about be nate and rue to I it just seem like she take advantage of jule be high I could be wrong",
          "I never say that the plot line of rue use jule as recovery be bad nor do I not show I do not understand why they be pair together quickly and also they could have still show she use as a crutch with they still be friend people can be codependent on their friend just as much as they would with their lover",
          "when I find out that jule be tran I do not pick up any clue throughout the first couple episode only get it until she say it loud herself when cassie have her organism during carnival ride and people be watch \" oh shit \" for cassie nate have all those d ck phot on his phone and it kind of look like he be still figure it out",
          "be that as it may besides the kis that jule give rue after the meting with nate what imply she s get romantic feeling for rue",
          "dang I didn t think of the trust vo like you mention though jule really only freak out when lexi tell she she s the reason so I do not know",
          "the thing be hunter say that they do not know how be go to end when they be film that mean she do not even know how be go to be in s the fact that she ship rule do not mean anything everyone ship they I do not know why because their relationship be not that healthy but I do not think the director be go to do what people want I believe he be go to do what he think be more realistic and I believe rue be go to die maybe that be what jule presage or maybe they will be together in next season maybe even jule die at this point anything could happen",
          "like rue be literally have the bad depresive episode of her life and jule ghost she for a week strongly contribute to that while rue be semingly almost die from her depresion jule be hok up with some stranger she just met like I feel like that first experience should ve be for rue I wonder if rue will be jealous or sad or if jule will even tell she like what be jule even on in the club like I think she snort coke but then she be act like she be on moly while have intense lsd shromy visual I do not know anyways I can not wait for the season finale",
          "yeah I find that a lot of time when people be talk about why rule isn t go to work out they mention that jule be realize she s straight but I think it s a lot more complicated than just her sexual orientation she definitely care a lot about rue and I m sure have feeling for she to but just because rue feel more doesn t mean jule s feeling be any les romantic she like rue but there s a lot of thing go on in her life that rue doesn t know about and rue be also somehow use she as a crutch to stay sober and that s a lot of presure on someone so young or anyone at all for that matter",
          "I know a lot have be say about comparison betwen romeo and juliet r j initial the costume recital of line rue as a male figure for halowen and euphoria but I do not think enough focus have be place on hamlet s paralel unlike romeo and juliet hamlet have be directly reference during the show with the painting of the death of ophelia by be john everet milais depict ophelia drown clutch flower now to make some reach when I think of the flower one character stand out jule from the first scene jule be asociate with flower wear a shirt with they embroider on she have also wear flowery eye make up in a few ocasion hamlet also focus on mental ilnes and mental degradation and as see with last episode and yes I know this be drug induce jule be not do all that well ophelia s insanity be garner through be subject to both physical and emotional manipulation throughout the play from those around her when jule be lay in bed with the \" revolving dor \" of the people from her past she be also in a way lose her grasp on reality after the manipulation she have experience as well as the romantic dysphoria betwen she and rue I can not fully guarante that jule will sufer a similar fate to juliet or ophelia but I can expect at least a subversion of their story posibly she almost do but in the end she do not I would love to hear your thought on this and anything you can add",
          "I see a lot of similarity betwen my first serious relationship and theirs jule realize early on that they be not forever but jule also do not have any issue with rue jule see interest be be rue s first and it be go to be exciting to be there with she through that jule do not seem to have ever have a relationship with companionship so this may also be a bonus for jule jule will hesitate to do wrong to rue because she do not want she to relapse so sacrifice her own hapines to take care of rue will be a main driving factor for kep the relationship go jule be go to find herself in this long draw out relationship where everything be fine but it be not right either jule will probably make a couple mistake but will see how it afect rue this be where she will fal in line and be a good companion to rue jule realize all of this and be acept it while she lay in bed she can not believe what she be get herself into but she realize that it need to be do hence why she lay in bed with eye wide open while still codle rue my prediction",
          "be real rue and jule have a toxic relationship the people eat it up though for whatever reason",
          "I be talk about rue fail completely and dependently in love with jule and jule not know what she really want seriously from rue quit drug because jule be all she need the touchy fely friendship the shot in the dark kis the \" high high and low low \" comentary and all the feeling rue show when on the topic of she and jule it be spot on I go thru this exact dynamic with my good friend and while it do not get as far as \" rule \" have there be something there and ultimately my friend do not share the feeling I do so it fal apart just like ali predict in ep be it selfish of I that I want to see rue and jule eventualy break up these thing seem to rarely work out and it would be more realistic give the curent dynamic i d much rather see rue get her heart break but eventualy come to term with have jule as a friend and build her own strength as an independent person because that be what I have to do lol and I think show that on tv would help a grant relatively smal population of people very much in get thru similar shit I think this kind of thing be a trope of be a gen zer much more young people be comfortable with be bi and with that come crush on friend its a problem bi kid face all the time and shed some light on it be so nice to see on tv",
          "I relate to so rue so hard but jule be amazing everything about her character be exciting to watch",
          "jule will break it off she be not one to setle and be scared rue will probably relapse and pis jule off then they will be friend again sometimes it be healthy to be friend then be in a relationship",
          "yes except I wonder how oblivious jule would be she be every smart and very sharp it feel out of character thus far for she to be that oblivious",
          "I know jule feel stuck because she realize she do not love rue the same way rue love she but do not want she to spiral this might be a reach but hunter talk about jule be and enjoy be in a quer relationship anybody think it might be with lexi she be stare a lot and I know she be already feel reject but it feel like a different stare anybody want to add in I be curious to what you all think",
          "I agree jule be pretty much the runer up as far as main character she have just as much screntime as rue however the show be about addiction and drug and jule doesn t struggle with either",
          "rue be bear day after which be since she be year old and a junior I be gues this be take place in in either or",
          "watch the interview with hunter after the episode she make it sound like jule be not use rue for aceptance but rather embrace that she do not need a man to love she and that rue actually care",
          "I do not ship they but I think the theory be spot on jule fal so hard for tyler dep down she want to believe he be still in there jule be such a naive character I think that be why it make sense to an extent",
          "the way she smile when rue texte her melt the world",
          "I think that s unfair they both don t deserve each other rue would rather escape than comunicate and try to love an addict who can be selfish and dishonest be def not an easy burden especially for a yo hs girl she also have issue on her own batle in her sexuality trauma from sexual ofender and live with an addict mom I think probably maybe her atachment to rue can be atribute to the fact that her mom s an addict and she may be subconsciously try to fix her which totally signify a toxic relationship and they also didn t clarify their relationship and would only hug or kis when comunication be need which have lead to hurtful circumstance for they both just because the pov and star of the story be rue doesn t mean she s always well deserve she s to be honest selfish to the people who love she walow in self hate and forget that gia gets hurt or that her mom have sacrifice a lot and that s why she should focus on herself bco you can not create a healthy relationship when you re not whole some comenter try to put the obligation of be the big and well person on jule because she s not the addict in the relationship while that make sense it shouldn t be her responsibility",
          "rue s character be not a bad one however at time it seem flat and force I know zendaya be the most well know of the cast member but from a character perspective I do not really see her story go anywhere she just struggle with drug addiction and be long for love and aceptance from jule I think jule character storyline have way more depth and have the potential to be more interesting for the show longevity this be just my opinion by the way",
          "true some people want so bad to jule and rue to be together that they can not see the whole panorama they refuse to look dep on thing",
          "jule definitely know and enjoy how much control she have over rue she totally bask in the adoration and use it to her advantage yes she be a tenager but regardles that be pretty hard to swalow",
          "I literally can not stop cry when rue go to jule house in tear because she do not want jule to get hurt like that shit resonate so much with I",
          "just come around this interview where I read a few thing didn t see they post yet obviously a bit of spoiler gt we learn jule s backstory through the open montage of episode it s be describe as heartbreake lt gt we also learn that rue be the first person who acept she without any question and that s why they bond so fast lt gt rue and jule will fight about something and rue will beg to remedy it lt gt and this episode have a well develop twist ending which set up the rest of the season lt source",
          "it mean that you grow up literally and with that and your life development you don t conect with a person or a thing anymore",
          "ugh my literal reaction to what character represent my sign arie",
          "I haven t see any indication that rue s relationship with jule be sexual she have describe she several time as her new good friend",
          "to be fair far as we can tell it may be an issue of incompatible orientation I m certainly pick up those vibe since jule be specificaly hok up with guy online easy as it d be to ship rue and jule I d like to see a show where both rue and jule can be healthy as friend but still realisticaly portray incompatible sexuality fiction always treat it like the end of the world and I ve never be a fan of thatedit I do hope she figure out it s nate at some point so she can get the fuck away from that though if I be big on bet i d say jule will figure it out before he do and I ll bet that masive birthmark be go to be what give it away I just hope they make it happen soon before some more mesed up shit have to go down",
          "I fucking love that you catch this that be so col I really think that she do in fact have feeling for rue but a lot of people just do not think that eh and thank for the time stamp omg",
          "true I feel like the narative be tell we jule be just another addiction for rue but also I do feel like she really like she",
          "same here I don t want anything to happen to jule that beautiful soul be cause my anxiety to go up",
          "can t blame jule for rue she didn t help but it be make clear throughout the season she be substitute one addiction for another I also don t think she relapse I think it be a flashback",
          "I really disagre that jule loves rue the same way I just do not see it it seem like she want to acept the love rue hand out bcus she want to be in a healthy love relationship so why not be in a healthy relationship with someone who have treat you well than any guy you have ever know and especially since they have romantic feeling for you already",
          "I feel like jule do not really know what she be get herself into and be just now hit she she love rue but she do not want to be responsible for she and she be realize that rue s well be depend on she now and that be huge for anyone x be a tenager",
          "because of jule and rue since the moment they met my gay little heart be rot for they after last week I be sure the show be not go to go in that direction and though it will likely be short lived and may be incredibly unhealthy for both of they they be so damn cute together I really want it to work out",
          "this episode be uncomfortable as hell I asume jule be fuck up over the be dependent on her and I think that s what rue believe to but base on nate s blackmail at the end I kind of think she be freak out over that maybe this be wishful thinking because I think they re cute as hell together as friend or girlfriend but I think jule feel trap by nate be efect her relationship with rue I know a lot of people say she s straight but I do not know I think it would be really easy to go in that direction but the show have be pretty subversive which be why I think we ll find out her true feeling once rue figure out what nate have do thought",
          "the name a hot take I never think about that but I be always ify about this rue and jule relationship rue really latch onto her quick and seem to not be able to do anything without she",
          "jule be also dres like claire dane in romeo juliet",
          "I think we re dance on the line betwen consensual and inapropriate jule may have be okay with it after it start but initialy she didn t want to hok up and she be high out of her mind",
          "I feel like she realize she have feeling for rue not that she be necesarily atract to woman in general in her drug haze she think she s hok up with a man and before she have comment that the woman remind she of rue",
          "I think it have more to do with depict the closenes of a codependent or otherwise emotionaly intimate female friendship at least that be what I hope they stick with I be not oposed to the idea of they end up together but I think that would be lazy of the writer female closenes in a one on one friendship be raw beautiful and rarely on display in the medium with the exception of girl and barely broad city as someone in a close female good friendship it be something I would like for they to explore without have to cros such a predictable line there be plenty of character that already give off quer energy but I hope they kep the bond betwen rue and jule platonic that be just I though",
          "do we even know if jule be atract to woman or not so far all we have see from she be browse gay date app to find man",
          "she s and she only really start flake after she realize how much rue depend on her I don t really blame jule but that doesn t change the fact that she s really bad for rue",
          "this episode be mean to highlight how imperfect their relationship be despite how much they may care for each other they still run away from their problem and miscomunicate rue either shut off and or start do drug and jule physicaly run away and cover it up with quick thril I e sex with stranger until they have some real growth both of they not just rue cleaning up and actually sincerely talk to each other these high high and low low will continue to happen in their relationship moreover they re still not together until we see a explicit confirmation of their status then each be free to do as they want though I didn t consider it cheat I didn t like jule do that and I didn t like that text at the end but it s certainly in character for she she s be through her own shit and she s try to cope with the fact she comit a crime under coercion I didn t like she drink her ass off at a party after be so forthright rue need to stay sober but it tie back to their miscomunication issue and the fact that jule have semingly not rely on anyone on a long time I hope it can be adres for some real development on their part",
          "co sign well put",
          "well even though jule do the shiti move in the last ep we should still take it under consideration she s the one who change rue a lot and she s be in a lot of shit herself lately to maybe it s just a phase I know she ll get her shit all back together in s",
          "ikr he do have sex with jule but she tell he that she be",
          "I suspect it at this point but it be only until they do the backstory on jule lol",
          "yeah I get what you be say it feel rush from jule perspective",
          "after tonight I get to say it be really hard to diferentiate I be lean toward she actually have a crush on jule",
          "yeah I definitely think that jule be go to get rough up or bad be that it be only they out I the midle of nowhere",
          "I absolutely love the mix up that its rue faling in love with jule and not the other way around like I expect when I start watch this show if jule gets hurt I m go to be so mad",
          "I don t see that it just seem like she be really interested in jule for hok up and jule be on a self destructive self discovery path and take part I feel like they both equaly consented",
          "I mean she s show interest in jule",
          "I feel like since the begining rue have a romantic interest in jule which be not reciprocate and I have a feeling it would come up but not so soon in the series",
          "be you fuck serious jule be a she delete this post",
          "fuck out here misgendere jule twice in the same post",
          "nah she could have set boundary especially when rue get romantic but she decide that she enjoy be worship and go on to play with rue s emotion",
          "idkw but this ep let I down a lil bit I do not get as many emotion as I be use to get with the previous episode I gues tonight s ep do not give we that much story anyway talk about jule and rue what do you guy think be jule in love with rue or not because I be kind of confuse by the thing jule be say when she be on the pol talk to rue in other point of view I do think lexi be in love with rue but I do not know what do you guy think",
          "I think so to but rue and jule do not even know each other and it look like rue be kind of impresed turn on from jule reaction so I be still on the board that that line refer to something that happen in e or beyond",
          "at the end of the day jule like man",
          "I have two idea about jule she really do not love rue back because she do not like the idea of comitment since she be always mess with maried man or she really love rue but do not want rue to get hurt or hurt someone while jule be in this nate situation because she would have to admit to rue that nate be who she be really texte I think jule could be struggle with that but you never know",
          "right that fit with my point she have reason to not disclose this stuff to anyone but I wish she could feel like she could tell rue with no sort of consequence I just wish they both could overcome those road block but yes they be both totally valid in feeling that way I just wish they would be open but they will not and that be a part of their character",
          "nah rue s super brief and horifying sexual history make it seem like she s never genuinely be into dude they ve get that we re broken people from shity circumstance so friend become family bond",
          "I think jule face at the end show that she be begin to realise how co dependent rue be on her multiple people throughout the episode like her dad and lexi kep tell she how she be the reason why rue be clean which probably make she uncomfortable and fearful because that be a huge responsibility and she know that if she hurt rue she will overdose or relapse if have nothing to do with her romantic feeling for her I also think that jule feel presured to be in this serious relationship with rue even though she be never be in one before and because her past encounter with man be always one off nothing more so to go from those situation to this comit one be probably confusing for she to the conversation about how many guy she have hok up and why she do it play into this theory plus if jule kised rue last episode because she be vulnerable like some people be say why do they show that montage of they it would be useles if that be the case",
          "it be a bit toxic in my opinion jule be more so use rue to feel well about the whole tyler situation and ali even talk to rue about she subconsciously atempt to replace drug with jule do not seem like it will be a healthy relationship",
          "I be rewatche the first episode and when rue be at school in what I be asume be a lock down dril a guy be point a video at she and make lewd gesture not sure if its she in the video or not it would fit with what we have see with other sexual encounter film and use to shame girl in the show also she mention nate try to finger she at a dance without her permision that be say I absolutely do think rue like jule as more than just a friend she seem very enamored with she",
          "I want they to be together because I think they make each other well and they could make each other so much well if they be upfront and honest with each other in my experience just be honest and acept of your friend be the good way to go about thing I think they be scared of what the other one will think if they reveal what be make they anxious I mostly mean jule feel presure and hide the interaction with \" tyler \" I think if jule truly love and trust rue she would be open about those thing and find comfort in rue they could work those thing out and kep trust in each other this be just how I see it but I also understand the character be not like I and they be valid for make the choice they do so I can understand jule not tell rue about either of those thing",
          "I mean its fair to say jule be a bitch to rue while still think she be a decent person jule be intentionaly lead rue on despite know her issue",
          "I feel the same way if they get together before rue get her shit together it will end in flame and tear",
          "b I agree she play that part so well she be like the fun suportive friend who be just along for the ride to gas up her friend and she do it well",
          "what do outgrow mean you mean that rue be become more mature than lexie genuine question english be not my first language",
          "yes thank you for the positivity I need it lol I never think about jule just be sad because she be high again my mind automaticaly go to she be dead probably just because of all the theory",
          "also it look like jule leave town somewhere betwen episode there be this frame of she at this train station in on of the trailer I do not believe she be run away I mean where be the suitcase or extra bag if she be she be literally wear she regular back up and be wear the same outfit in another scene of a trailer where she be stand in a car with a guy I think she leave in episode and come back after posibly hang out with these new friend we have yet to met yet",
          "rue got second choice it be unlikely that you ll be happy with someone who second choice you",
          "and that confusion and insecurity be on both side rue even question why jule be use a gay date app and jule doesn t really answer so even though jule apear so fully confident in be a girl she obviously still harbor insecurity or concern regard the type of people who would be interested in she because she s pre non op I m honestly really apreciate the subtlety this show be bring into the development of these character because I think it s so eye opening for many of we who don t think of the day to day of other in a different situation than our own",
          "yes this be much close to what I be think but I think maybe kat be scorpio",
          "rule for rue and jue for jule or vice versa only because both of they equaly deserve to be the first part of the nickname",
          "anyone else from this thread remind a little of \" shyguy \" ask jule when she start transition and ' apologize ' for be intrusive",
          "rue initiate the first kis not jule when she do its after getting blackmail by nate I take that as she look for comfort and then we have this episode be jule kep tell her dad that she and rue aren t a thing",
          "I understand that it just seem like the line be super clear with everyone else on the show it seem like everyone else but rue be make big sexual endeavor I pick up on what you re say",
          "all those dick pic weren t to send jule two of they be black dude",
          "rue be literally incapable of have a healthy romantic relationship at this point in her life and recovery her brain be eroticaly emotionaly transfer onto jule only intensify she already present atraction and afection from before her sobriety jule be rue s new addiction and rue do not know how to compartmentalize yet",
          "you get handsy with people you like want to touch she wasn t do that with anyone but rue xb my point about her rudenes be that be drunk leave she with no filter lexi anoy she by call she out her drunknes and she fire back right away if the writer be make a point of jule not be into rue they could ve easily make she snap at her tell she to leave she alone or whatever",
          "they be both dumbas like romeo and juliet they nod to it several time in the series swim pol with angel wing etc",
          "I asume they be both equaly high I do not know also I think jule somewhat use the hokup to see if she be into girl in general and not just make an exception for rue",
          "she s not in love with rue",
          "I agree I m surprised that what people be take from this episode be that rue only like she as a friend to I it seem clear that their issue right now be jule kep the nate secret and feel responsible for rue stay sober but like op say hunter kep talk about jule be in a quer relationship and ster away from man so yeah I think she want to be with rue she s just scared of hurt she for whatever reason and make she go back to drug",
          "I wonder to like would jule enjoy the conventional way",
          "I ve think be about her relationship with jule for example when jule tell she about live in new york first seem like an anectdotic thing and later rue put herself in the fantasy she tell ali that they talk about live together jule tell she that she be act weird and she said its not true and the she be not jealous about tyler",
          "also when she say to that girl that she remind she of rue my first reaction be why because she s black I don t see what else they have in comon",
          "I think I empathize more with jule because I understand some of her problem I be not tran but her problem with her sexuality and her bad love experience make I feel close to she I understand why she act like she do with rue a lot of people throw shit to she because she be hurt rue but I understand her decision",
          "I actually love the rue and jule part I think that be the beauty of the show though everyone can find something in the show that they relate to in someway or that they find interesting",
          "I kind of get vibe that she be jealous when gia say rue s in love with jule last episode",
          "so the other day I see this post from euphoria and the caption highlight there get I think about romoe and juliet I be wonder what happen in the begining of act thre of romeo and juliet so I get out my handy romeo and juliet bok and start read the third act sure enough it be the part where mercutio gets kill by tybalt then romeo kill tybalt so I come up with a theory throughout the story I have see a lot of romeo and juliet reference this one be especially alarming so at the begining of the third act of romeo and juliet mercutio gets kill by tybalt and so in turn romeo kill tybalt so in this comparison mercutio be fez tybalt be nate juliet be jule and romeo be rue now this make sense because mercutio be one of romeo s good friend and tybalt be one of their enemy who happen to be the cousin of juliet like in romeo and juliet with juliet and tybalt jule and nate don t really like each other but they be still link to each other so I think that fez be go to try to kill nate but nate be go to end up kill fez in the next episode how this will happen I do not know but I have an idea its go to be nate and fez in a room together then a black scren we hear struggle then a gun shot and we will not know who die until the next episode but if my theory be right then fez will die then in the next season rue be go to plot to kill nate and kill he this also work because we think that rue and jule will die and romeo and juliet die but hopefuly that doesn t happen also one of the most important theme of euphoria be love and the same in romeo and juliet everything that be do be for the purpose and love of another person and love would be the drive of everything that happen in my theory now if you think that kiling be a little extreme then maybe we could substitute jail or a serious injury for death this could symbolize the death of a character ability fredom or even reputation if they even have a good one in the first place tell I what you think",
          "I literally say that rue do not make smart decision either she just be not on the same level as jule though sure she do drug recklesly but I still feel like she have some sense about she",
          "ya I definitely feel you on this I think we see that they have move past it in the next episode and I do believe jule have a lot of compasion for her they be relationship be complicated but they both care for each other so that be good could not handle if jule do not \" get it \" plus would not be great for the story line I think we be go to see a lot more go on here and hopefuly rue will open up more instead of run away that be life it be not always so black and white",
          "I know that if they try a relationship in the state that they be now it would probably end up bad because jule and rue be both mentaly fuck up rue have addiction issue and jule have trusting and self love issue but at the same time I can not ignore the fact that the existence of one another into their life be the principal reason why they be hang on",
          "the theory be as folow euphoria be similar to romeo and juliet in many way first of all rue be short for romeo and jule be short for juliet second of all jule wear what juliet wear in the leonardo dicaprio version when juliet and romeo met for the first time in the halowen party scene third of all the forbiden off time love story betwen rue and jule top the cake this can give the audience some sort of foreshadow to how the show be go to end thought",
          "rue be definitely into jule but do rue \" know \" I kind of get the impresion still watch e that she do but the I also get the impresion that she have no idea",
          "do not get I wrong I have be in a few relationship but none where I feel that crazy or none where the other person make I feel like we be the only two people in the world either way I love their relationship and how real it feel it just kind of break my heart that jule may not love rue as much as rue love she",
          "so there s only around hour leave for the next episode and I feel like jule have these many spiky moment over she and rue s relationship may be they foreshadow a future breakup or that jule be hide something big than tyler also the scene of rue crying in the trailer for episode I love the show the character and everything about it rue and jule hold a special place in my heart during to my love for the actor in part especially zendaya see rue fal back down to misery might be something I can t handle especially see how far she s come I hope all go well for her in other news I m super pump for season hope they don t ruin the great flow they ve got go on and maybe we can petition for the episode to come out fast than once per week",
          "it would explain how rue know that jule didn t trust her enough and how rue seem to be all know in her naration",
          "I be afraid for jule if she survive she will not end up with either",
          "jule and rue s relationship be haphazardly build on rue replace one addiction for another and jule need comfort after be catfishe in a humiliating and intimidating way that end in blackmail the show portray it as such but some people in here look past it",
          "this be what I think to before see another theory that they would not end up together this be before episode I gues I want to be really open with the idea just in case I would love for they to stay together I gues the fact that jule be not really open with her dad it be ok not to share every personal detail about their relationship but it seem like she might be ashamed and the guy from rehab talk about how it would not last get to I it would actually be genius if the show put all this potential foreshadowing but it actually work out in the end by the way go look at the other theory if you have not already I actually think they have really good point about they stay together",
          "also remember that they be all interconecte kat may have tell her story to jule and jule tell it to rue and so on at some point they tell one person something and that person only tell another and eventualy everyone know they have stres this kind of behaviour multiple time in the show",
          "it s not empathy so much as it be just know that people do stupid shit sometimes and project someone else s issue as a reflection of your perceive relationship with they be toxic af rue doesn t love jule because of the way she dres or because she s touchy and flirty with her just the way ana only see jule as some kind of idea of hyperfem sexuality and not as someone she want to live a well life for",
          "rue mention be bear a couple day after so do that mean that this be suppose to take place around or be I mis something",
          "I be neutral on they from the begining I think that jule be definitely a decent friend but not in a place to be the rock that rue need I still care about jule but I have no desire to see rue with her romanticaly rue will never get well with the wish washy way jule treat she she seem to care genuinely about rue but be terible about show it she make rue feel like she have to be something she be not she know how rue feel about she but still fucking flaunt ana in her face when rue try to be responsible and say I need to go back my family my medicine jule blow it off and let she cry jule in no way shape or form need to be in any comitment right now and rue have to learn to stand on her own I be so proud of she for go home and then damn ow",
          "jule so far be absolutely one of the strong character I have see on tv betwen stand up for herself to nate at the party stand up to that same psycho in tonight s episode after the carnival and say this to rue while deal with complete heartbreak betrayal and fear I myself would have completely break down into a hot mess this girl deserve everything eta by no mean be I say she deserve everything that have happen to her she deserve hapines safety love suces respect I could go on and on",
          "she choke the hell out of nate and throw he against the wall and kis he once the rest of the time she be flip betwen ana and rue she be most definitely realize her atraction to rue and woman also hunter have say in multiple interview that jule realize and be enter a time of quernes",
          "yea jule basically just fuck that up",
          "jesus christ I love the contrast of the dad jule dad cal the drunk dad rue s deceased dad one of the thing I wish I could understand jule her dad clearly love she unconditionaly he s there for her she have his total aceptance and love but she s basically as much a stranger to her father as nate be to cal now cal be toxic for sure but I feel like jule could actually talk to her dad without wory about his judgement why doesn t she let he in also I want jule and rue to stay together forever",
          "I actually do not realize jule be tran till this episode I feel dumb but totally agree there be a lot of good moment in this episode",
          "I think rue just tell this story out of order some thing make sense while other don t didn t fez call jule then drop they off at her house when she take the fentanyl think the mckay stuff be just his fotbal carier in highschol we haven t see he play in colege yet and rue have od d once and I think her sister be the one who pick she up from hospital",
          "do anyone else really dislike jule her treatment of rue just leave a bad taste in my mouth every episode she be constantly project her problem onto she and make rue feel like it be always her fault and nege she and then tease she with a kis so she stop be mad until she decide she be not atract to rue again and shut she down I really hate watch her jerk rue around and I just want she to make a decision so rue can move on if she be just use her I know guilt for her secret play into it a lot but half the time it do not even seem like jule actually like be around rue for anything but attention",
          "yeah jule say everyone here know I m trans to rue in the third episode while they re talk about tyler rue talk over her but you can still hear she and the subtitle say the same",
          "I second that I really don t understand the fascination for jule in comparison to rue",
          "I do feel like they be go to go through the whole rejection thing with jule and then have rue spiral and my heart will b r e a k but I wonder if rue be a lesbian bi pan or if it be one of tv s most famous trope the its ok if its you zendaya play long very well with mj in the new spiderman with her def hide a crush on peter and here with her painfuly obvious crush on jule bles",
          "they re just prediction I know rue be a virgo but she doesn t exude virgo energy",
          "nobody literally nobody rue it all start when jule move to town",
          "right you could tell the girl ana be into jule the moment she walk into the room and probably figure she would try to hok up with jule later on",
          "she do I feel like I rue when she think about jule I a healthy way I just love her mostly because I ve be have conversation about be a great person and I can t even say I know more than or people that just good people but I feel like she would be great person if we met",
          "I m not convinced that I will continue to watch it but for now I m in there be mystery to it slight tension that might lead to something we didn t know what would happen to jule when she met nate rue s scene with that dealer be pretty nervewrecking I be hope they don t hurt her the show just give a thril",
          "I be start to get a weary feeling about where jule storyline be head the show start with rue s od be a struggle drug addict etc jule be the one who help she out of her darknes but it seem they have switch role and jule be fal off the rail understandably so I wonder if something bad will happen to jule atempt suicide at the end of the season as a juxtaposition to how rue arc begin",
          "and jule be cry",
          "I don t think there s a big issue with jule and her dad underneath it all I see a strong fondnes for her father and a bit of an understanding regard personal space when her dad be ask about her relationship with jule he poke and prod a little but jule didn t want to open up but she smile at he very warmly nonetheles as though there be an unspoken understanding that she apreciate the interest and the reach out but also know he ll leave she alone if she d prefer to kep it to herself just like with the dominantdady hok up he want to know more detail about where she be go but chose to trust her judgment instead of take a hard line it look likely that the separation of her parent be due to disagrement over jule gender identity and that her father take her side and support she she probably love he to no end for acept and support her or maybe I m just see what I hope to see we ll just have to wait and see how the story unfold",
          "maybe she be just happy that rue be finally happy even if it be bcus of someone that she might be jealous of and besides jule seem really friendly towards she so maybe she be warm up to the idea of like she",
          "yeah I be think that to but I be sure there be a bit of physical atraction as well remember the first time rue see her bike jule definitely catch her eye then",
          "maybe it be because rue never feel the way she feel about anyone else before and jule give she an ultimatum in one of the early episode",
          "you re partialy right on the rue dynamic but I firmly believe jule have a similar level of atraction love that she just doesn t know how to expres yet I think at this point or hell maybe from the very begining we know the falout be come the two of they be not in the right state of mind to maintain a relationship let alone the rolercoaster of emotion that be rule rue have a lot of grow up to do she still doesn t really have a purpose yet be a junior she hasn t expres any future plan for education we haven t see she indulge in any interest or activity other than drug use or hang out with her friend at least with jule we know she have aspiration of go to fashion school the only thing rue have say be that she ll folow jule wherever she go that s a big no no she need to learn to be ok with be alone in her own head first and foremost there she can start to develop cope mechanism from there she can adopt healthy habit that hopefuly turn into goal she can pursue in the future then once she s a real person we can revisit rule the thing with jule though be she s no picture of perfection either she s more experienced than rue that s for sure but random hokup doesn t teach you what it s like to love another person and how to nurture a relationship with rue all that experience count for nothing not just in term of physical conection but how it feel to be with someone who understand or at least try to you as a human being rue doesn t like jule because she s tran she doesn t like she because she look the way she do rue like she for who she be and that be something new and scary for jule even without all the nate issue put presure on she and deal with the fear that one wrong word would send rue spiraling into a relapse jule still doesn t know what she s do when it come to foster the feeling she have for rue mainly because she s still just a kid strip away all her surface issue and past trauma and you still just have a kid deal with their first real relationship it s clumsy and awkward and everything be magnify but it s real I ll ride the rule ship until the end of the series and I know it s go to get really fucking ugly but I maintain my position that the two of they be end game it may take time and a hell of a lot of work but they ll find each other one way or another",
          "moreover by not have jule as the protagonist it help normalize authentic transgender character",
          "I think its interesting how jule be the one who fantasize about live with rue for the rest of her life but then she slowly start to realize that she doesn t want to be anchor by rue like ali say it s inevitable that jule be go to break thing off it s just wicked sad that you see how rue be tell her mom and the na group about jule and how she love her and how jule tell her dad that they aren t a thing and then she freak out when lexi tell her rue be well because of her its like jule get what she want and now she want do ditch out",
          "wait wait wait what the fuck but rue be in her house for like hour while jule be in la with hanah they have never met the fuck",
          "no doubt I think jule be still try to find her place in the preview for it show rue and jule kis underwater and happy so I wonder if jule figure out what she want or if this be where rue unreliable narating come into play",
          "I gues nothing else really I just do not think the reason be because maybe jule have gender preference maybe it be just that rue as a person be not for she",
          "though I agree with they not be in a romantic relationship I kind of disagre on the whole understand each other because they really do not jule be to busy catch up in her own world to really care about rue s addiction and disorder while rue be just an outsider look in on jule life she be infatuate yes and know thing about her but time and time again she mistake jule afection for love so friend maybe but soulmate I do not think so",
          "do she only realize it when she go back to jule house in the first episode and jule take off her clothe or do she already know it I be surprised in that scene because rue seem to already know that jule be tran I e have no reaction whatsoever and I be simply wonder if I mis something thank",
          "I be all for rue and jule to get romanticaly together I hope it happen when rue get all blushy about talk about jule to her mom be adorable I just do not know if jule be on the same team but hey I be all about it lol you",
          "yeah probably just friend s jealousy but this stuff be unpredictable see the promo and all those sad note of the future episode gues how rue be about to heal her broken heart l e x i or o x y",
          "as we see in episode and rue be like really protective of her sister and she even threaten to potentialy torture troy if he get gia high again and when that be happen I be like cher on rue in the background she be also really protective of jule which I have mixed feeling about I want she to let go of jule but at the same time it make I happy to see rue change as a person she just do not want gia or anyone she care about to be miserable and end in a place that she be in",
          "jule and rue forever if they split or stop be friend I will become a bad person",
          "jule just have a strange encounter with a maried man and cut herself and rue be high as fuck if they be not a lil weird I would be surprised to be honest but sometimes it be just a matter of what part of the episode be write first",
          "I totally understand why rue do what she do with jule near the end of episode yes they be good friend and jule be into shyguy but she be also pretty intimate with rue they slep together spon say \" I love you \" and do that intimate forehead touch I also understand people can be super close and just be friend but when someone do thing like this do they really not have any feeling towards the other person I really like jule as a character but I also really feel for rue and it seem like jule be lead she on a bit especially when she know rue be jealous which would sugest she could tell how rue really feel be anyone else feel this way",
          "I still do not think jule be be overshadow she have arguably the high amount of screntime nd to rue",
          "I get more platonic vibe betwen they fez kind of act like an old brother to rue",
          "totally mean jule my mind be overwhelmed right now lol on the topic of rue though she be excelent as well she definitely shine when she s sober but I don t know how long that ll last for her she be always try to protect jule because jule have a habit for sketchy situation they re like peanut buter and jely to each other",
          "wow you guy make way to much excuse for jule she mess up simple she really do mess with rue s mind and emotional being if they be mean to be then they will be together in the future when they be both good but right now yes they be extremely toxic rue be to dependent on jule I mean home girl didn t even go pe and jule go from be in love with tyler right into a relationship with rue and be deal with to much right now I hope in the end the show be really tell tenager relationship like this be not suppose to be ship in real life rue jule be toxic nate maddy be toxic nate jule extremely wrong and horible but it be ship and romanticize",
          "how be the montage indicative that she like jule it seem more of she be vulnerable than anything",
          "yeah I m a sucker for a good female female love story in the pilot episode when rue say she d still fuck nate I be a little disapointed because I think they be use the trailer to mislead we all into think there be go to be something betwen she and jule but at least they didn t completely trick we her crush be real it s just heavy and more complicated because of all the other element suround it",
          "first I want to say so I be in love with jule I want to take her home with I and introduce she to my cat now it be a good thing that I be high when I watch this episode because the stres level be through the fucking rof jule baby stop fuck texte the represed violent sexualy confused jock and just get swet with rue I do not need the stres there say it",
          "I don t I do think jule do flirt back but I be not sure if it s intentional or not girl be comfortable among each other but I don t think they way she be with rue I gues we shal see rue need s a hoby or some other friend outside of she as this show go on",
          "while this be ofcourse a very good point we don t yet know if rue be also struggle with her sexuality in adition to her addiction or just in general not be able to form any meaningful relationship in the past perhaps partly due to her self estem we see an example in rue s think naration I m such a loser she could be just fal for her plain and simple I totally agree with you that it s not jule fault I could see their arc s either go with with jule realize that she s bi this would probably make a lot of shiper happy p or like you say it s part of rue s arc to overcome the issue s of be an addict which seem more likely",
          "we see that one when jule be hok up with guy",
          "I think they hint that in the preview when jule talk about tyler rue look a little deflated",
          "why would she ever hate jule",
          "yeah I think she be stres because of the nate threat to she get upset when rue kep mention his family at lunch jule have not even tell rue about it yet which imply that jule might be to scared to tell anyone about what happen she cry in the bathrom because of it I do feel like rue be go to find about the nate situation though before the season end maybe jule will tell she or something else happen I feel like if they comunicate a little more with each other it will make their potential relationship a little easy but jule do not want to let anyone in right now she be stand ofish last episode and do not trust rue right now",
          "kising be most of the time sexual and the next episode after that kis reu be already pretty much say they be date and she be still kind of of not sure at the same time for all we know jule may not even think they be date and that be only in reu s head she be the narator of the show",
          "fair enough my whole thing with rue and jule relationship and I mean that in the sense of what we ve see thus far up to the end of episode be that it seem build on an intense level of intimacy not necesarily sexual rue share her story of addiction and jule share her sexual discovery and a level of imense trust exist betwen the two now whether rue have be atract to jule from the begining we still do not know if rue identifie as a lesbian pan or quer maybe there s a more apropriate term so please let I know if that s the case or it s a byproduct of her addiction or just be a curious kid I do not know what I do know be that scene in episode where rue apologize to jule be one of the most intimate exchange I ve ever see be it on tv or real life when jule embrace rue and their face to face literally hang on each other s next breath how the fuck be rue suppose to interpret that situation other than how she do then we come to episode where we get more of jule history where her bud sexual identity seem as rue say to be cis white straight man jule say she doesn t top which make sense to I so her sexual orientation as I see it be as a straight female which again I totally get but then after the falout with nate she go to rue as a both a friend and as a place of comfort hunter schaefer the actres who play jule have say in interview that the two view each other as their respective home which be absolutely lovely to I but then we see that beautiful montage of they get to know one another and how comfortable they be in each other s presence and jule go for that kis be it a moment of pasion a suden realization of sexual fluidity I do not know if that s the right term or be it just hey I like you and this feel right at this moment and that s all it have to be so where do they go from here I feel like if they decide to pursue a romantic relationship then eventualy sex would be involve and that could mean anything to anyone but I feel like in this particular pair there be certain logistic that need to be discus again this be a hypothetical scenario about fictional character on a television show so I apologize for get way to into it but couple like this exist so that s why it pop into my head about the potential for such a moment to discus",
          "do not see the hype around rue she have the generic edgy rebel personality I have see it many time before and most that go wrong with she be her own fault so I can even feel sorry for her rue and jule have not get much chemistry whether it be the writing or act I do not know their relationship feel force",
          "there s no doubt that everything go on with jule be go to come to a head base on how zendaya and hunter talk about the character be home for each other and kind of a light in each other s life I do honestly think rue be go to at least try to pul jule out of whatever be go on the same way jule inspire rue to get clean I m hope they can work through their co dependency and be positive force in each other s life but we ll see",
          "seriously she didn t even act as a friend would leave rue who be clearly in distres just to have some fun seriously I love her character but be truly disapointed with how imature and selfish she be in this episode also she fal in love with pretty much with anyone",
          "okay maybe not a theory but kind of like my interpretation when rue come to jule in the pol she try to get she to come out of the pol then jule start recite shakespeare and what the verse basically mean be that she like rue but this be move to fast and maybe right now be not the good time to be together but some day maybe they will be right for each other after she finish say that rue think to herself and maybe ali be right because this doesn t feel good she then whisper to jule to stop this part really hurt for I you can hear the fear and desperation in her voice as she s ask jule to stop in my head she s no long ask jule to stop her act and get out of the pol she s ask she to stop talk like this stop say that thing aren t work stop be so drunk because I know you re do this partly because of I prop to zendaya because her delivery on stop okay can you stop stop stop stop that be like a knife that twist in my heart",
          "it s definitely a complicated situation that could be resolve if they talk to each other lol but you know how tenager be jule be hide the nate secret from rue and that s obviously afect her in tonight s episode rue s vo do say I don t know why jule didn t trust I so it seem to imply that rue will find out eventualy whether through jule or not we have yet to see xb I feel bad for rue because she s not even the one put all that presure on jule she s not the one say I m stay clean for you it s all these other people around they who be tell that to jule rue be just act normal she doesn t even seem to put presure on the romantic aspect of their relationship",
          "I think I be the only one who think this not much happen this episode but I believe it be need as it build up set up next episode next episode look like it be go to be really drama fil I be woried for jule and rue edit I do not think jule be in love with rue it be very one side atm and rue and jule need to figure stuff out for themselves before they can just jump into a relationship lexi seem like she could be in love with rue but I be not sure yet",
          "yeah like every time I see rue smile with she it mess with I because like if you think throughout the show how often do you see she happy her face be always emotionles she be always zone out then jule come and she be her knight in shine armor like I feel that I be the same way",
          "rue fal head over hel in love with jule from the moment she met she let we not pretend that jule be the only impulsive one when it come to claim love",
          "short answer they go to therapylonger answer comunication need to be have comunication in relationship whether romantic or platonic be incredibly important so that everyone be on the same page one shouldn t think that everything be fine while the other be look for escape route and try to find a way out jule need to be up front with rue about how she feel and how important she be to she as a friend she can t make rue stop do drug because that be rue s own choice and batle but jule can help guide she and stick by she as a friend rue be still very important to jule and it would devastate she to see if she relapse and something happen to she so jule will need to help jule find a way to be more independent and les co dependent on her rue already have co dependent issue because she doesn t face her painful feeling and instead subject herself to drug to mute and mask her painful reality I admit it be dificult to face incredibly painful feeling I also get emotional and sufer from anxiety and when something hurt I it hurt I deply and it be not a good feeling at all that I want to get rid of quickly but it have to be do jule as a friend and as someone who truly care for rue need to support she through this",
          "eh I feel like jule be have a grand old time I be more put off by she tell the girl that she remind she of rue when she be literally nothing like rue aside from be part black",
          "be I the only one that do not ship they I feel rue be at that point where she be well off alone and just have friend there to support her rue need to learn to love herself before anyone else",
          "they ve be glue to each other s hip since episode rue hasn t change around she since the kis jule do xb not sure why you re get the impresion that rue be force a romantic relationship on her she be even ready to forget about the whole thing in episode if you mean ask to slep at her house again that s just the way they ve be act since they met like how many time have these two share a bed by now rue be probably just use to do it at this point",
          "something I notice more upon rewatche episode last night be that during rue s apology she catch her breath when jule hug her like sure there s the exhilaration and nervousnes of be so close to someone you re atract to but her anxiety of hypothetical scenario where jule gets murder during a hokup or never want to speak to she again be disolve almost instantly every other time rue have have an anxiety panic atack she s need or turn to drug to calm down but she s find relief in another person be it healthy to rely on someone as a cope mechanism not entirely but it s well than substance abuse for the time be with jule it s a bit more complicated we haven t see her character episode yet but from my own perspective I see she as just look for aceptance not in the sense that she want people to perceive her apearance as female as a transwoman but who she truly be as a person every kid struggle to find their own identity and I d imagine its exponentialy more dificult for someone in jule position from the moment rue see jule on her bike to when they oficialy met at the party I feel like rue have acept she still not sure if rue s intention be always romantic or if it s a by product of be a tenager and an addict but regardles rue see something in jule that I do not think she jule see in herself she doesn t present as depresed or shy but there be obviously past trauma she s deal with in adition to be new at school and not to mention be tran so she probably feel defensive at all time be imediately and totally acept by a stranger must be shock so its understandable why the two of they form such a sturdy and fast bond whatever the falout of rue s kis and jule future hokup misadventure might be and wherever rue s atempt at sobriety and jule orientation evolve into lead this will be one of the most interesting relationship dynamic I ve ever personally see in television or real life can t wait also I definitely ship they as a couple but certainly would not mind they stay good friend as long as all their card be on the table in term of expectation and intention",
          "I m confused af right now I strongly think that rue kis jule because of her afection for her because she s so nice and acept of her I wouldn t judge her sexuality base on that kis she might be pan though",
          "man I really be not a big fan of jule right now and it be this final episode that do it I be frustrate by her fake woke personality it be imature and she really do not take rue s feeling into acount this episode like make a decision and stop play with her she be a fucking addict for christ sake",
          "jule be literally the nd most important character in the show nobody be be discriminatory to transgender and rue be suppose to be an unlikeable character that you want to see improve",
          "I could kind of see her replace jule as rue support person if thing go leave betwen the two",
          "man can you imagine if they pul a modern romeo and juliet like rue think jule run away and know nate be the reason I hate say this as well but in this scenario I see lexi as mercutio the friend that die and set romeo off nate will mess up somehow and fataly harm lexi which will triger an already spiral rue into go after he rue kill nate like romeo kill tybalt then she od s because without jule she do fentanyl again that shit be dangerous jule learn that rue have die and that she kill nate so the guilt she feel overwhelm she to the point that she kill herself just a theory but I see it line up so well",
          "okay it might just be I but the entire not real interaction betwen nate and jule get I feel some type of way like I know he be chaotic energy but also I just want jule to finally find someone that will love she for who she be that \" most beautiful girl \" like have I tear up lowkey also I be def shiping rue and jule at the same time and hopefuly these bitch can get the freak on and love each other lt",
          "I totally agree also I love their friendship I want they both to have a really good friend because I feel they each need it so badly they could probably be much well friend to each other than get into a relationship with rue be fragile and I absolutely agree that rue need to focus on herself and not a relationship she be not go to be a good partner for jule like she be right now",
          "I know I would love they to stay together probably not but one can dream if anything happen would hope that they stay friend and rue still find help in jule even after everything I would also hope this show have a happy ending for rue I just feel like I relate to she a lot mostly because of sexuality it be just so weird zendaya be such a good actres definitely one of my favorite",
          "I just hate mis thing I wasn t expect a particular reaction but it strike I as unrealistic to have no acknowledgement of it at any point by rue edit and in case you be wonder I don t think a reaction be require or that jule be tran be some kind of issue that need be acknowledge it just strike I as unrealistic for the fact to be unremarkable to rue in the world the show have create",
          "I think it be definitely romantic love for rue",
          "I agree with everything you ve say folk who don t believe that jule return rue s atraction be not pay attention even hunter have make clear in interview that what rue and jule feel be real even if it isn t healthy in its curent state",
          "so during the jule flashback rue mention that jule imagine spend her life with her good friend and live together in new york I can not remember the exact word and I plan to rewatch and update this post but aparently rue mention that jule tell that to rue be that corect be that imply that jule tell rue she like she I be super confused by that part",
          "I m not say it s like it euphoria be to unique however the forbiden bit be more speak towards how jule feel about rue we see that she feel many complex feeling and how she doesn t really let herself like woman except the last episode do break that down a bit but I be more just talk about the reference they have make in the show",
          "it just feel like they re mistake friendship for love and that rue be more invest in jule than jule be it s pretty obvious jule be not only straight but more into nate tyler but that guy be so mess up that she probably need rue to know how it s like to be in a relationship where she isn t treat as a sex object but at the same time rue s clingines to jule be not healthy you can t build a relationship on dependency and there s no way jule be go to quit man to be with rue that s not something that be go to happen",
          "initialy I think she speak in past tense about jule mean that she be likely tell a story about her lead jule to an od jule just wouldn t make it like she do then an episode later we clearly see that jule isn t down with rue s drug use which be when I realize she s talk about basically everyone in past tense kat be the second one I pick up on that hadn t be completely atach to a flashback I think she s in a spot similar to she be pul to the front of her class and be ask about her sumer maybe stand on stage at one of the na met sometime in the near future or could be therapy posibly from within another rehab center a sumer over we see in a moment of what have seem like the bad of her addiction that the memory of her sumer be still painful for she to recount and she simply do not want to talk about or relive they I think for rue to be speak about these event in detail she have likely open her eye to the severity of her situation and wake up however I be with you on that last bit something be go to have to happen to get she there and it s not go to be pretty",
          "amp xb I love jule s makeup it really highlight the stres and turmoil she be go through she look rather unhealthy and unhinge not like she usualy happy go lucky self I really wonder what be kep jule from tell rue her secret about \" tyler \" and nate what be the bad that could happen lexi be here kep everyone safe and be the only thing kep literally everyone and everything from fal apart like you go girl the pol scene where rue be contemplate whether ali might be right because \" this do not feel good \" break my heart when she start kind of whispering to jule to stop you can hear the desperation and fear in her voice it break my heart when she get out of the house and lexi ask she what happen and rue say \" I be a burden \" it break my heart I be notice an almost reversed growth in both rue and jule when you compare they both at the start and now at episode we can see rue start out as be mess up and not even bother to try and stay clean and now she be really work hard at make amend with people and stay away from drug and alcohol protect gia make sure jule get home safe on the other hand jule start out really hopeful and bright and now that she be get so much shit throw at she she be start to fray and give in to the presure it start out as rue counting on jule to stay sober but now I think rue be play the role of try to get jule back to be normal again and face her problem I wonder what make rue cry I know it be because of jule but why exactly I can hear the reasoning in my head but can not quite put it into word be she woried jule be not who she think she be do she feel like jule be change do she feel like she have lose jule and jule do not care about she anymore rue confronting roy or troy about gia make I laugh more than anything else this episode I love when we get to see her protective side when it come to her little sister rue apologizing to fez break my heart and when they both say I love you I be really sad about rue and jule they be both hurt and they do not comunicate with each other for some reason I hope the next two episode will involve they actually talk to each other about their need and concern about their relationship the verse take from romeo and juliet in the pol be such a nice touch I love that they do that if anyone be familiar with the game life be strange a similar thing happen in the prequel before the storm and it bring back nice memory for I",
          "rue s vo do say I don t know why jule didn t trust I so it seem to imply that rue will find out eventualy I be gues it have something to do with her mother abandon her she might have trust issue with woman in general",
          "I didn t catch on until the thing where she be talk to tyler about they met on a gay date app which be how I asume nate s dad met her I be like why would jule be try to hok up with gay dude oh",
          "I never say they would end disastrously they can both just acknowledge that rue s health should be prioritize and part way",
          "yeah I think that be what the show intention be from the very begining like rue be go to like jule as more than a friend and I don t know maybe jule will be oblivious to it and rue will be to scared to even tell she how she feel I do not know",
          "I don t think it s that they ve forget it s just that rue hasn t really be clean long enough for all of it to come into focus she s still act like an addict above all else except now her addiction be jule",

          "I think you be spot on about jule and rue be more about jule be vulnerable and know rue be into her I think jule love she as a person and a friend but I would be shock if they end up have a real sexual romantic relationship I think this will crush rue in the proces and leave we hang for next season",
          "its not jule fault she s not lead she on rue be just latch herself on to her other people have say that this be actually really comon with addict",

          "this be what I think to before see another theory that they would not end up together this be before episode I gues I want to be really open with the idea just in case I would love for they to stay together I gues the fact that jule be not really open with her dad it be ok not to share every personal detail about their relationship but it seem like she might be ashamed and the guy from rehab talk about how it would not last get to I it would actually be genius if the show put all this potential foreshadowing but it actually work out in the end by the way go look at the other theory if you have not already I actually think they have really good point about they stay together",
          "jule have no idea rue be go through a bad episode of depresion they both lie to each other and tell each other they have the flu it s not like jule know rue be go through a bad time and decide to ghost she anyways she s go through her own shit herself you know",

          "be I the only one bother by the fact that rue cite jule for the reason why she s get sober like you d think gia and her mom would be the reason why since they be her family especially gia be the one who witnes her sister s near death this may just be I I just find it it bite od I mean I do think in a way jule be good for rue but I don t think she should be the sole reason",

          "yeah it look like they will take part of the episode show the consequence of rue s decision and then the rest of the episode show they be go to be okay since they met up in the promo for the next ep I think it be just hard because jule seem to be the only person after rehab that rue feel conect to and comfortable with and maybe that make she think she like jule as more than a friend or maybe she really do like jule as more than a friend",

          "I mostly agree with you I think their sexual relationship be pretty boring because I do not see it go anywhere I do not think jule be into woman I think rue be have a realization that she be likely bi or lesbian especially give her background of seem completely disintereste in the guy she hok up with so I apreciate that aspect of their relationship but that will only be explore once she do not have jule as her focus addiction I think jule feel bad for sort of lead rue on but she be vulnerable after the whole tyler thing and do not want to push away someone to actually love she so once again interesting but more because of what it say about jule than the actual relationship betwen they I hope to god they will still be friend when thing end but I also see the ending lead to a relapse for rue",
          "sure rue may seem healthy compare to douche nozle nate but I don t think the pair on they be go to be any good when her sponsor ask she what it feel like when she s with jule and he s say drug this could turn out bad for the both of they",

          "I definitely think rue be into the kis it feel like rue have the epiphany that she like kis girl while lexi wasn t really into it",
          "I think the stuff happen but everything be over dramatize it be not like she be go around in a detective costume she prob just discus to with lexi",
          "there be definitely a convincing amount of evidence to believe that lexi do have feeling for rue her behavior throughout the show towards rue rue never stop to consider how something might afect lexi s feeling but despite that lexi always consider rue s the favor she do for her the look on lexi s face at the carnival when gia say she think rue be in love with jule the bit in rue s sexual history flashback where she talk about teaching lexi how to french kis where rue seem unbothered yet lexi say it be weird and uncomfortable for her etc there be article and whatnot on the internet that describe it probably well than I do but tldr yeah I think lexi do have a crush on rue",
          "I didn t see it as an eye rol lexi definitely have some thought about it but they aren t clear to the viewer yet there be a reason why the writer add this scene of rue s sister tell lexi about it and I do feel that there be more to it than she outgrow the group gues time will tell",
          "I know I be super late but there be many thing that hint to she be in love or have feeling for rue they would not just add gia telling lexi she be in love with jule for no reason show do not do that and in the first or second episode I think maybe the third when they be do the cherleading pep rally thing in the cafeteria if you pay close attention everyone look at who they like nate look at mandy maddy look at nate kat at ethan I think rue at jule and lexi at rue then lexi kind of freak out when they kis I do not know it just seem like she be into rue and I do not think she be asexual but more like a les sexual person but still enjoy it just very vanila",
          "lexi be gay I do not know lexi feel a little to much like a support role in the show to get a spot in the finale I want to know her backstory but she seem to neutral right now someon s go to die I can t believe I didn t sense the tension I binge episode for sure hand down blood will be she would someone could die",
          "I feel like rue be really in love with jule that she block everyone out at the carnival she even leave her sister behind not just lexi",
          "not the only one to I that scene be suppose to show we rue realize she be into girl after all the montage be about her sexual history the focus be only on her reaction to the kis I m with you on the asexuality theory she hasn t show interested in anyone her mother mock she because her halowen costume isn t sexy enough she find the kis with rue very uncomfortable she didn t think rue could be into jule posibly because that doesn t even cros her mind people think that she stare at jule and rue together be a sign of jealously but to I she be just feeling replace because they be good friend before jule come along I notice they stop make her stare at they now that rue be her friend again there be no longing look anymore and I think that tense moment in the halowen episode when lexi call jule out be the perfect moment to add some jealously plot but the writer never go there so I do not know definitely lean more torward asexual than secret lesbian crush",
          "my opinion on lexi be that she might be a loner we haven t see much of she on the show so she might have other friend but we really don t know she seem empathetic with rue but she gets overshadow in this episode when jule come up and talk with rue and she find an escape out the situation",
          "eh agree to disagre like I say there s a lot of hint go on with lexi so I wouldn t be surprised if that s the route they take with her character",
          "that s true I do not see the evidence point towards rue and lexi having ever be in a relationship that would be surprising if it do turn out to be true",
          "I feel like lexi will kill herself since no one notice she probably not though since she s jud apatow s daughter and nepotism be alive and well in showbiz",
          "I ve be re watch the show and I find all the shot of lexi just longingly stare at rule a bit to intentional to be just meaningles there s practicaly one of these for every episode plus that conversation at the carnival with rue s sister seem strange to I even when I first watch it rue be in love with jule don t you think I haven t really think about it proced to sadly stare at they I do not know I may be read to much into it but I find it interesting since we don t know that much about lexi yet other than the fact she s a literal pure angel this seem like it s plausible so far",
          "actually that scene at the carnival where gia say she s think rue be in love with jule be kind of weird she say it so awkward and casualy like gia know lexi be into rue or that something happen in the past that s still touchy for lexi",
          "I agree plus when they kis lexi seem unbothered while rue be like I think I m into this",
          "I think it s just like you say they re set up lexi to be the friend who be go to be there for rue when jule leave I think that s just it nothing romanticaly or suicide relate like other sugest",
          "I think they might be purposefuly go for a jealously storyline betwen rue jule and lexi whether it ll be romantic jealously or friendship jealously it remain to be see but I think it s safe to say that right now lexi fels replace by jule xb it look like they ll hang out next episode so maybe we ll get some answer xb",
          "I love maude apatow and I be so excited whenever she be in a scene I kind of get the feeling she be be replace by jule at the carnival I be happy to see jule and rue kis but the romantic part of their relationship seem really one side I feel really confident that lexi will play a big role soon and I be wonder if she will be a romantic interest for rue be i totally off do this feel like a posibility to any of you",
          "she explain that she be teach her when she pul away she look at she weirdly and then lexi say \" be this super weird and uncomfortable to you \" be rue uncomfortable I be really confuse by this scene how do you guy interpret it",
          "since this subredit be easy to down vote anyone with differ view let s get a thread go with different opinion mine be lexi isn t a saint she help rue a drug addict pas a drug test I get it she s a teen put in a bad spot but why be she give leway for be a tenager but everyone harp on maddie be an awful person because she s in an abusive relationship and be also a tenager who be put in a bad spot you guy can t have it both way also the hate for kat have any of you ever be the ugly invisible friend that take a tol on one s self estem she find new find confidence despite it be misguide she s no idea what to do with her new find hotnes the way she treat ethan be horible I get it but you have to realize she s be suround by hot friend most her teen year and for once a cute guy she like genuinely show interest in she she revert back to that shity feeling of be ugly because how can she compete with the hot blonde these be thought I m think she may have base on her reaction should she have ask he what that be about definitely but she s a tenager teen act on impulse not logic",
          "oh god the whole \" let I make it up to you lexi \" scene be so sad to I imagine get a text like that from your bf that really be not your bf anymore but that be literally the extent of your social life expect she to make it up to you in some nice way ge I do not know maybe som quality time just the two of you but no she bring along the person who she replace you with and the way it be shot really show how lexi be third wheling example how we see rue and jule skating and behind be lexi just ugh my heart",
          "they have to do something with the lexi character and yes she steal scene just stand there and look anxiously at rue",
          "this be a well thought out theory and make a lot of sense whether or not the conclusion be suicide there be definitely hint that lexi will become more important later on",
          "agree rue and lexi have the history and I think lexi be genuinely inter in rue well be not that jule be not it be just that a plutonic friend can often time be a much well support system than someone who you be romanticaly involve with especially in rue and jule case",
          "I love how think out this be I never really wonder about lexi before more just wonder how she get to be such a high name on the list of actor and actres on the show with little line but this make I really excited for her upcoming episode and conect to she in a way that I hadn t before",
          "at one point I think lexie do like rue but I just think she be kind of jealous because she know rue have replace she with someone else I be not go to rule out her be in love with rue but I think it be more reasonable to say she be jealous until we see her backstory mix with cassie",
          "yes I notice that roler skate next to the bed but I kind of forget about these young clip I love when smal detail like this be tie together this be so swet",
          "be anyone else secretly rot for rue and lexie to end up together I know they have be good friend since they be kid and almost anyone seem healthy for she than jule but lexie seem to know how to handle her emotion and tend to her need and I think they would have a good relationship",
          "I understand why so many viewer love lexi and for the record I think she be a breath of fresh air amongst the character however I gues I see she as an enabler and while I think she mean well have a good heart she constantly let we rue walk all over her I feel that lexi be extremely insecure and instead of stand up for herself and set boundary she let we rue and her drug addiction dictate their friendship lexi really should not be give rue clean urine if she want she to clean up and get sober while I adore lexi for other reason I gues I view her friendship with rue diferently I do not think rue deserve to have lexi as a friend and I wish lexi would stand up for herself their friendship be unhealthy and rue take advantage of her I be wonder if anyone else feel this way",
          "sam have big plan for she in the next season and I don t know if anyone else have notice this but the only two character in the to have break the fourth wall be rue and lexi",
          "to I that look be lexi realize she s be replace as rue s good friend like you say lexi be a loner she doesn t have any friend look back at all her scene I think lexi will comit suicide I post why",
          "on the late episode when rue and jule hug at the park you see her sister and lexi talk about it and lexi just brush it off like she do not want it to be a big a thing and we be talk about it on discord and maybe lexi have some feeling for rue could this be a thing on the future just wonder what other think also feel free to join the discord stickie in the front page to come and talk about the series with we",
          "nah I want lexi to be with a girl",
          "yeah well now that rue have realize that she be a bad friend towards lexi maybe their relationship will develop",
          "could this also be rue be an unreliable narator not realize lexi be into she",
          "I have the theory that unfortunately thing betwen rue and jule will not work out because exist a large probability that nate end up fal in love with jule and vice versa I definitely could see a romantic relationship grow up betwen rue and lexi because that scene leave I wonder to I be even go to write a post about it this morning but I be to slepy to remember lexi name ahah",
          "rue walk off on lexi just as jule have on kath rue and jule be big big personality with heroic quality but let s be honest about it both can be totally inconsiderate I love they but they re a little chaotic and very undependable",
          "lol you all hate and you all mad because rue want jule and not lexi",
          "I have always view lexi as the one person with their head on straight and part of I think she s outgrow the group",
          "lexi be a non entity",
          "not an unpopular opinion just respond to your initial post here I very much dislike kat people like she really do exist but they need to get out of their own head a bit specificaly kat in her situation if it s that your ugly because of a health problem it birth defect or acident then that s a different problem but with the information we have so far all that kat need to do be lose weight wich be not easy at all and see a psychiatrist about her self estem she may never get the perfect bod but she can definitely be objectively atractive not everyone be look to date a supermodel I just wish it be aceptable to tell that realistic and positive story this whole like I as I be and I win t change no matter what thing that kat have go it s just sad acept who you be shouldn t include be a cocky ashole",
          "maybe good theory honestly most of the character have a solid reason to comit suicide if they want to lexi seem to be the most level head stable focus and drama free character she seem like the type to kep her head down folow the rule get good grade and be sucesful in colege unlike the other who be be traumatize kind of over and over but we will see lol",
          "not everything have to be so sexualize lmao it be posible that lexi just care about rue as a friend",
          "yeah and episode the minute spech scene lexi stand for rue like a lot how rue treat she be terible",
          "I be like in agrement with you I do comment last week that I get a vibe from lexi that she maybe love rue more than just \" childhod good friend \" but this episode kind of make I lean toward she just really mis the dynamic she rue have the way she give jule credit for rue s hapines when they be at the roler rink do not seem like a girl who be consciously in love with her good friend and understandably jealous of the girl who be the true object of rue s afection I be open to the posibility that the writer still have not show we a lexi point of view episode yet at this point omniscient narator rue probably would have say something if lexi have actual romantic feeling for her but maybe that be a slow burn character narative personally I would love to see maude apatow be give something a little juicer to sink her act chop into that just the third whel replace good friend",
          "I want more of rue and lexi they be cute and their relationship be healthy for rue",
          "I d say it seem that lexi and rue be good friend at some point cassie maddie and kat seem close but all of they together i d say they aren t close friend",
          "please do not let that happen lexi do not deserve any of the shit she go through ugh",
          "I imagine her reaction be more towards rue being in love with a girl as opose to jealousy they ve give no indication that lexi be anything more than a childhod friend",
          "wait actually no the reason I and many people think lexi like rue be bcus of that random ass conversation gia have with she about her noticing that rue like jule and her stare longingly at they it seem so random that it look like it be try to introduce a point and even then there be a scene where everyone in a class stare at someone they like and lexi stare at rue while jule have give no sign that she like rue or even hint like that like the one mention above",
          "I feel like rue like lexi but lexi do not like rue at the time and then thing get awkward betwen they and they start to isolate themselves from each other but I feel like lexi be now start to have feeling for rue but it be to late because rue be in love with jule or rue like lexi and lexi like rue but do not want to say anything but now she regreting not tell rue about her feeling or they be in a relationship and now lexi want rue bck and I also feel like when jule ask rue if she be every be in love I feel like lexi be rue first love",
          "I think lexi be go to be the one to help pick up the piece when rue and jule blow up if they do",
          "wonder the same thing she be very clasy compare to the other character maybe they be go to showcase she more later we have already get s confirm or perhaps she be the foil of normalcy amidst the chaos of pretty much everyone else even gia be sufer the efect of rue s behavior and act out a bit be lexi a bit naive or withdraw or just not as spin out as the rest",
          "I agree for sure it seem to be something of an unpopular opinion though get more popular with each episode but I be not really a fan of rue and jule together their relationship be very toxic while lexi have be nothing but an amazing friend to rue all series of course you could argue that the way rue have treat lexi in return all series would make a lexi rue relationship toxic to but as rue have stay clean she be realize how bad a friend she be be and have make every efort to make up for that to lexi also you may or may not have see about lexi s character that raise some really good point",
          "I can t point to a definitive moment on scren I gues it s more like to each their own and you believe what you want to believe in you know it s more unconscious procesing I think like a lot of people think lexi have feeling for rue but I don t see that at all some people don t see jule be romanticaly atract to rue but I do that sort of thing",
          "I honestly just see lexi as an ace person like it would be really col to see that sexuality be portray because it s not that comon like as a demisexual person I really get vibe from lexi that she normaly do not get sexualy atract that often by other people but also she can just be shy I go through that to anyways can not wait to see her development in next season",
          "I do not know if this be mention already but lexi have a lgbt pride flag hang in her room",
          "it seem that when rue and lexi kis rue realize that she enjoy it while lexi be weirde out by it",
          "I think lexi be hela jealous of rue and jule and we be go to see the falout this after jule break rue heart later on in the season",
          "you can also see roler skate next to lexi s bed for example in episode at",
          "it be definitely a posibility there s a scene where everyone be look at who they like and lexi look at rue",
          "I have not already end season but I m completely into this ship I love they so much I think they should be together even if it could be to predictable and that s why I think this be not their choice",
          "this I be not against the posibility of lexi be lgbt but I just do not get the vibe that this be some one sided childhod crush even during their kis in the flashback rue seem to enjoy it more than lexi do",
          "the first episode in episode gia make a comment about rue being in love with jule and lexi be clearly disatisfied and then they hit we in episode with rue and lexi kising and lexi look sort of confused and panic episode don t give that same vibe show they more as friend it just doesn t feel resolve yet",
          "ya I get jealousy vibe to like maybe she have feeling for rue but she dosnt know how to expres they also after rue sister say that do lexi send rue a txt right away to see if she would answer or be she just try to not act interested in the conversation lexi character be play by maude aptow so I doubt she will be place as a background character",
          "gt rue s be bewilderedthe right word for it look when lexi break the kis for I it seem like she be into it but then be wonder why lexi stop also I could not tell if lexi ask rue if it be be like really weird and uncomfortable for she be lexi project her own awkwardnes or what anyone else have a different interpretation of the scene lt",
          "I think so I wish the show explore more of lexi she seem like kind of a loner but I be sure she have a dep dark side that could be fascinating plus maude apatow be a great actres",
          "really I just haven t see anything that sugest rue like she seem like they would ve hint at this at least instead all we have be hint that lexi like rue",
          "now I m not say lexi be definitely crush on rue but I think you guy be take lexi s response to she and rue s kis at face value lol as a lesbian who be closet all through school I can tell you for sure that the weird and uncomfortable response from she be a textbok reaction for a teen girl who s not really aware or be try not to be aware of her sexual orientation internalize homophobia be a thing folk and plenty of wlw have experience it anyway judge by how acurately this show have portray tenage saphism I wouldn t put it past they for lexi to actually be atract to rue and that that be suppose to be our signal for those of we who would recognize it so I m on board the lexi rue ship",
          "in episode two during the pep rally scene lexi look at ruerue be at the table with julesnate look over at madydaniel towards casieand finally ethan towards katwhile it hasn t be make clear with lexi rue nate daniel and ethan all have some sort of romantic sexual interest in the character they look towards and acknowledge albeit all be dysfunctional relationship what do you think about this I see this as more evidence towards lexi be into rue some foreshadowing for what s come next",
          "lexi have be show to be upset about the and jule together lexi want rue",
          "I m rot for the oposite because rue need friend like lexi and fez no need to make it complicate by put they in a relationship",
          "I ve be think about this show a lot I have so many favorite character like rue jule and fez the person who be inside my mind lately be lexi she may be a background character in this show but I feel like there be more to her character we hardly know about maybe that be who she be someone who be always there and kind to people we all know her home life wasn t great grow up either I feel like we all know someone who s be like that especially high school I wouldn t say I be exactly like lexi in hs but she be someone who I wish I have as a friend because she will be the type of person to listen I do see myself in some variance in she like when I go to hs party I would always be in the background and not someone who everyone really look for lexi have friend but be not their person to go to when it come to other social ocasion hs may suck for friendship for her but the colege life will definitely get well for her I guarante it anyways I think lexi be such an interesting character in this show there be so many way the writer can do with her character she may be a background character but I feel like whenever her episode come in it will be a good one",
          "I agree with other comment I have see that lexi be atract to rue and her kis she be a confusing uncomfortable awakening to that fact but it could be the reverse that she feel uncomfortable that rue seem so wiling and good at kis she that she want to end the posibility of a relationship",
          "the fact that lexi compliment jule at the rink it s because of you it seem like she mis her friend I don t see jealousy when they re at the rink I have that may be go out the window because of this episode but it s build on among other thing rue be lexi s only friend I wouldn t be surprised if rue lash out at lexi for push jule away with her comment",
          "fez be not mercutio it be lexi I proclaim",
          "I feel like lexi be love in rue but the feeling be not mutual",
          "I and my friend have be debate this for the entire season we bet so this be really important I first say fez because of that little interaction they have at the party when he say \" I like you \" and the way he treat she in general and how he be wiling to kill for she my friend say that he like she like a sister but I disagre because if they really be that close would not they say \" I love you \" maybe I be overthinke she say that rue be go to end up with lexi on the basis that they have be friend forever and that lexi have a crush on rue I do not believe that she be go to end up with lexi because of the way rue interact with she and by how little she apear on the show and how little she be talk about think about it rue know everything about each of the character and what they be think but do not care to talk about lexi I believe she be just a background character because rue seem to know a whole lot more about cassie than she and they never even talk to each other I do not think rue be go to end up with jule even though she be in love with her I do not think the feeling mutual and jule be scared to let rue down especially since she have struggle with drug and life in general I think rue be go to run away probably with nate because he be gay and like jule and jule like he back with jule and lexi go that just leave fez maybe I be totally off what do you guy think",
          "I notice it to and if you pair it with lexi s conversation in the bathrom when rue have a panic atack I do think your old friend know who you be dep down it also could be a reach",
          "I don t think lexi be in love with rue but she be just sad that she doesn t have a friend to hang out with anymore I do agree that lexi be a loner though",
          "but what throw I off about it be that lexi do not seem weirde out she seem concerned that rue would be weirde out I can not tell if lexi be just a kind person in general or if she like rue",
          "lexi be a good friend for stick up for rue against that girl who say she s get brain damage",
          "I know I be super late but there be many thing that hint to she be into rue not necesarily gay but maybe quer plus I think she may also be gay okay so first off in the cherleading pep rally scene in the cafeteria in the first or second maybe third episode everyone turn to look at the person they like maddy look at nate or vise versa kat look to ethan rue look at jule and lexi look at rue in the scene where they french kis and lexi kind of freak out be kind of strange when gia mention specificaly to lexi that she think rue be in love with jule you can tell she get a bit uncomfortable and the show would not just casualy put that scene in for no reason so lexi mention she be never be into two guy at once which could mean she do not like guy or she be posibly ace while yes this could all be \" reach \" as you say in your other reply year ago lol there be many hint that indicate she probably like rue",
          "interesting theory now that I consider it they may be kep her scene at a minimum so we have enough time to know she be there to but not enough to the point where we be so focused or atach to her character plus it would be a shock yet also saden as lexi have prove to be one of the more sane quiet kid from the show",
          "to be honest lexi s be a little more of a general statement it may not be in the finale but I wouldn t be surprised at all if she eventualy end up come out and to be honest so many crazy thing have hapened already lead up to the finale so you know that for the finale they re go to go out with a bang",
          "no he just see rue as a young sister we don t know enough to say he s asexual if anybody be it s probably lexi",
          "I feel like there s never be any romantic feeling betwen lexi and rue",
          "yeah I mean I don t want to rain on anyone s parade but the show seem to be push for rue and jule a lot even cast member be openly say they ship it even though the storyline seem troubling for they I don t think they re go to make rue move on to someone else that quickly xb also if they want lexi as a potential love interest for rue she need to get more than just line per episode lol maybe in the future but right now seem to be just a childhod friend reconecte thing",
          "true but could that be part of rue be an unreliable narator and totally mis the sign that lexi be into she",
          "do you all think lexi have a crush on rue or do you all think she just really care about she as a friend discus",
          "do not see your post until I post this but damn lexi remind I so much of my high school self it be insane",
          "oh and rue teaching lexi how to kis be a reach girl do that shit all time doesn t mean there in love",
          "I think the dynamic betwen lexi and rue be that they re two friend who have grow apart seem like lexi be happy that rue and jule be hang out but also sad that rue doesn t have time for she anymore",
          "I think the quer relationship she be enjoy be with rue I do not see lexi and jule at all",
          "I mean sure a romantic feeling could be a posibility but as of now I just think it s a strained friendship it seem like rue use lexi when it benifit she",
          "even with her minimal scene I be lean towards the idea that lexi have a thing be in love with rue she be always be suportive of rue and never turn she down pe in a cup for her episode when gia tell lexi that rue might be in love with jule lexi give off a surprised then nonchalant look whilst still stare at the pair when gia leave she alone with they I would like to believe that there be a reason why that tiny scene be leave in the episode lexi seem to be the \" loner \" character who happen to like her good friend if it do not work out with jule maybe lexi will be there for rue",
          "lexi be a character that I want to see more from I like she and your theory be",
          "I get what you mean it s seem to I like before rue od d she and lexi be close but since come out she hasn t try to reach out to she unles its when she need something while I enjoy rue and jule together as friend I feel like rue may have latch onto she because jule be a fresh face and didn t judge she",
          "rue to I seem unphased lexi be the awkward one it seem like rue come there to do what she say she be go to do which be teach lexi how to french kis by the way wtf french kising be where you stick your tongue in the other person mouth xb she be take aback because it seem as though lexi be not as clueles about make out as she might have think which I think be because lexi be really into it xb lexi be the one lean in draw out the kis xb lexi ask if it be uncomfortable because she herself enjoy it but might have be question her sexuality during this time and be feel at that moment overwhelm and confused rue though I don t think that be a look of enjoyment on her face more like hm I think you didn t know how to french kis xb also in this trailer at around second the naration say something about be lostand lexi be show on the scren lose like confused about her sexuality be a loner in general and not really fiting in or have anyone to confide to xb I think part of lexi s subplot will be about she come to term with her sexuality there ll be a moment where rue find out but I don t see that be anything major just like when rue and jule make up at the carnival but not as complex lexi probably do at some point have a crush on rue but I think that pas over fairly quickly and go into just how much she mis have rue as a friend I also think there friendship will repair itself later on with lexi be more present in the series and she be more at ease with be gay xb there s only two more episode after episode and lexi doesn t have her own episode so there can not be to much go on xb tldr lexi be a lesbian she probably have a brief crush on rue but that s not a major story line",
          "to I lexi be one of those friend that everyone know and hang out with but only when they have to convince their parent of something from what we have see lexi be pretty \" stable \" compare to the other character so it would not surprise I if she be one of those character that tag along",
          "rue feel something when she kis lexi that she hadn t feel yet in her brief and horify sexual history",
          "I think lexi be gay and have a big old crush on rue that she s come to term w",
          "she s definitely a main character but I can t quite figure out what her role be why be she hang out with gia not really rue at the start of the episode if anything she react awkwardly and start texte to gia tell she that rue be in love with jule I think lexi stand out to much to be support cast and they establish she have know rue for her entire life what s the end goal here of her arc",
          "I think you make yourself clear that this isn t because people be asume lexi s sexuality it s because people be ship she with rue and it go against jule rue nice try though I m glad you show your real reason instead of there isn t any evidence you re reach",
          "even more reason to push rue away if she want to she be pretty rude to lexi",
          "I think that be the route that they re go to go with when gia say rue love jule lexi have a look on her face",
          "amp xb baby rue amp lexi vs teen rue amp lexi seem like skating be kind of their thing I m a rule shiper but this be swet",
          "completely agree as well I really apreciate that they be able to get a piece of lexi s story acros to we with those subtle instance it make she apear as insignificant which be exactly the way lexi myst feel herself this show be so briliantly write film",
          "I think lexi probably have feeling for she and would be open to be use more but I m really hope rue in a good enough place by the end that it s a non issue",
          "this episode kind of confirm for I that lexi genuinely care about rue more than a friend I be go to especially after that flashback kis scene I think that lexi will be the one there to help rue when everything go to shit with jule what do you think",
          "everyone out here fal in love with rue fez jule now lexi while she s out there gamble with her own life",
          "I just don t think that lexi be into rue romanticaly could be wrong but they just seem like friend who have grow apart and lexi be saden by that",
          "I feel like they be use lexi and rue as the comedy relief duo on the show and it s really refreshing because this show have I tense as hell most of the time I really like see they together that way just think I d share that",
          "it s a theory but I doubt it the director of this show just release a feature film with the actres that play lexi in he know she personally so I don t see he kill she off just to send a message about suicide her role in the show admitedly have be limit but frankly so be her act chop I haven t really be blow away by anything she have say or do in the show",
          "before you read any furth the post contain a posible major spoiler from the synopsis of the pilot script that be publish about a year ago so if you have not read that stop read now anywayif rue do end up kill nate as the og pilot script say I think lexi will either a help she kill he or b help she cover it up this be not base on anything specific that be say in the show but it be rather just a bold prediction base on rue and lexi s dynamic as well as lexi s semingly grow importance to the story I feel like we be naratively be fol into believe that she be not go to be a major player in the show but she will play a key role towards the end of the season I kind of see lexi as a chekov s gun in a way anyway I might be completely wrong here since again it be just a bold orediction more than an actual thought out theory but I think I would just put it out there",
          "source anyway that be super disapointing to hear since lexi s one of the more likeable and compeling character at this point in the show I be go to",
          "lexi s character largely be in the background but lately she s get a lot more screntime each episode we get a little more lexi and that wory I for her sake save for last week when rue texte she we don t see anything from lexi s perspective she s always react to something from one of the other character we never see she do her own thing she s pretty much in the background since she s get more screntime as the show near the season finale I think something be go to happen to she she be go to do something that afect everyone else maude apatow have second biling in the credit which be weird for a character that so far doesn t even have her own storyline I think we will find out why she s credit after zendaya by the time the season end",
          "you talk shit on lexi of course you re go to get downvote i d call that a radical interpretation of the text do you consider yourself a shity person ya know since you re not a saint I hope not but by your own logic you should so all op mean be lexi s just another one of those good old average every day american siner who sometimes prioritize the need of other above do what s moraly right she s just like we so seem like maybe you need to think before you speak and beforefo you downvote",
          "there be a lot of reason why it be obvious lexi be closet but do not want to confes her love for rue",
          "imagine if lexi be the narator I be glad she be not but we would literally know everything she be friend with rue cassie maddie kat etc rue even say I think it be about the dick pic on nate s phone lexi tell she about they which also side note rue say she and lexi be not even really friend but lexi must try to talk to she because she tell she these thing which make I kind of sad for my girl lexi lexi literally know everything and she do not even care she be just wait for rue to be her friend again",
          "about jule or rue liking lexi because from what I have see I think jule like guy more than girl and I could see rue and lexi over jule and lexi but that s just what I think",
          "definitely I have a gut feeling the second he run she over that their story arc be now tie I notice the above at first watch so it make sense when shyguy be reveal so such good storyteling on the writer",
          "honestly I hope they do not I see how it could happen and I can totally see rue get close to lexi for support but I would be so disapointed with lexi if she fal for it she know what rue have be through and she must know that rue as a recover addict would not so much love she but more use she for support and to not be alone I hope lexi be there for rue when she need she but I think they become romanticaly involve would be a little to much",
          "it s nice that while they might usualy be comic relief when a duo neither be really comic relief character",
          "I need to rewatch but didn t the kis scene imply that rue feel something and lexi didn t she look kind of bored while rue be like oh this make sense to I xb I think they become close again when thing go bad with jule but probably nothing more than friendship",
          "rue and lexi be good friend when they be young then thing start to go bad in her life her dad get sick then the drinking and drug so they drift apart but aparently never completely sever their friendship cassie and lexi be sister so it would stand to reason that she know rue fairly well but would still only she she as her little sister friend cassie seem to consider maddy her good friend and be close with kat maddy though seem to be close to kat than she be cassie remember in episode it be kat that she call to stay with when she be upset about nate I also see in one of the season trailer that jule and maddy start hang out at some point though this just maybe part of nate s plan to make sure jule do not crack",
          "rue seem really dismisive of lexi even during the few time when they ve be show hang out like at the carnival or roler rink she act as if she s not even there most of the time I do not think rue would act that way if they d have some prior relationship",
          "lexi be the friend that rue bring with she to the carnival with her sister and also have her pis for she as well",
          "I be kind of regard that scene I will say that I think lexi react strangely to I it seem like there be more to it than she just be a little disapointed about posibly be ditch at the carnival however I be not sure that it be because lexi be romanticaly interested in rue I think rue and lexi s dynamic will start to play a big role during the later half of the season so it will be interesting to see where the story take their relationship",
          "I would love to see a budy cop show star rue lexi and jule",
          "my favorite character be lexi play by maude apatow who at least so far have sadly have a pretty minor role in the first couple episode it be show that she be the childhod friend of rue and someone who still care a lot about she even if they have drift apart over time in episode rue come to the carnival with her little sister and lexi then rue run off to go talk to jule and gia go off to see her friend and lexi be just leave there on her own and then never show again for the rest of the episode I do not get why rue and jule do not let lexi hang out with they at the carnival and include her instead of leave she out it seem like nobody talk about lexi on this sub so people probably do not care to much about her but I like the character a lot and I think she deserve well and to be include more",
          "I do not know maybe I be reach I think they be probably more than likely to end up together then jule and rue even though they have show really no sign of lexi be into girl",
          "I think it would be awesome if lexi have feeling for rue",
          "I hope we get a lexi episode this season I m intrigue by her character why kep help this old friend who clearly just use you",
          "I want she to have romantic feeling for rue so bad to be honest I ship rue and jule but I kind of ship rue and lexi to and I want another lgbt character on the show",
          "nobody in rue s life have be surprise that she s into jule and she seem to make a realization about herself when she be help lexi practice kis so if they re really so tight that he consider her family I bet he know that she s more into girl",
          "thank you it be the darkcircle and that pierce eye up stare I really want rue to call lexi light and then lexi call rue l because how can you not",
          "call I an optimist but I think they be endgame maybe not this season but perhaps in the next or series finale some of hunter interview I have see read have somewhat hint at it as well along with the overwhelming support the ship have do not get I wrong they will have to work through a lot like rue codependency on she with sobriety and jule issue with nate cal but I think there be genuine love betwen the two",
          "I know people really like the idea of they together but I just don t see it I think lexi probably mis rue s friendship more than anything it doesn t seem like she really have anyone else",
          "to be quite frank a lot of people that comit suicide be see as stable drama free on the outside because if the issue be obvious on the surface there s just a high chance of external intervention in my experience a lot of depresed people just try and put on a mask every day while try to deal with their issue alone until that doesn t work anymore but in lexi s case I m also not sure she do seem at least focuse homework shot but still something be probably brew",
          "I think we have already establish how all of the other character costume represent their personality but no one talk about lexi s bob ros as you all may know be the quite calm dude who provide a lot of comfort to the people who watch lol I be get emotional sorry he be genuinely a nice dude same can go for lexi who be the calm force of the show it also paint what role she have in this episode where she be busy try to help and provide comfort for her friend some example include be there for rue when she be at her low point and give her reasure word and her prevent mckay to see cassie bcus if they be to breakup it should be in a les chaotic situation anyways I love lexi you all I really do",
          "do anyone else think lexi act weird when gia mention that she think rue be in love with jule like maybe lexi like rue as more than a friend maybe I m read into thing way to much",
          "this scene fuck I up I think she do not understand the line betwen friendship and romantic love but still it hurt to watch",
          "no I think lexi be just a girl that mis her childhod bestfriend edit why be this be downvoted lmao how about say why you disagre",
          "I do to maybe she just look young or maybe I even think rue say lexi have a young sister or something I do not know why but I be with you I think that to gues we be wrong lol",
          "I think rue still feel like she need to protect gia and lexi will be a good safety net she might relapse but this episode prove it isn t definite",
          "also though in that scene lexi say \" be this totally awkward for you to \" or something but still could go either way",
          "lexi be the one who pul away and not rue rue didn t seem to have a problem with it lexi be the one that be weirde out",
          "ya especially after lexi tell she she s the reason rue be clean",
          "I don t believe they re endgame but I think they be go to be together for a while after rue and jule separate and rue lean on lexi be i the only one",
          "yes she be all around the good friend and sister anyone could want but I feel like the whole world be go against her rue be so mean to she in the bathrom and then ditch she again at the carnival I really can not wait for a lexi episode also bob ros be the shit they should not have be clown she for such a dope outfit",
          "I agree I kind of feel like lexi be to rue what rue be to jule but les so do that make sense",
          "when she and rue be react kis there be a rainbow carpet in lexi s room I feel like that be not just put there for no reason",
          "yea I think lexi be really just rol her eye",
          "I m see people say lexi be to boring to have her own episode but do you guy think that s true because to I there s so many thing the writer can do with her character and they already hint at lexi bring in love with rue but there s most definitely more",
          "she could be both jealous and suportive I always think that jealousy in film and tv be a bit exagerated and that most people wouldn t act like that in real life at this point it isn t clear if lexi be truly into rue but I do feel like it s head that way why else would they have rue s sister tell lexi that rue be in love or show the flashback scene of rue teach she to french kis that say they do have lexi say that the kis feel uncomfortable and awkward which could mean that kis girl just isn t something that get she go unles she say it to cover up the fact that she do feel something and that she didn t want to make thing awkward herself gues we ll find out soon enough",
          "I don t ship they I think rue need a healthy friend which I think lexi be she seem to have her good interest at heart",
          "I feel like I m one of the only people who take the kising scene as imply that lexi isn t into girl as opose to rue who be she do make a strange expresion but the first thing out of her mouth be be this like really weird and uncomfortable for you which doesn t really feel like a that be well than I expect and now I m confused thing to say I think the scene betwen she and cassie in the late episode be hint towards she not be into guy but that also doesn t automaticaly mean she s into girl she might be ace irc kat mention asexuality to maddy so at the very least the writer know what it be I think it d be col if she be since I can t think of many positively portray asexual character on tv right now outside of bojack horseman and maybe shadowhunter",
          "now I be not say she should have be pick because I actually like the idea of rue s character be the main focus but even then it be not like her character can not still be that and lexi still get to narate everything but even then I be not say she should have replace she I remember think to myself as to why rue be the narator since in a lot of show and movie the narator be usualy a character that be very observant of those around they and introspect about other around they a lot sure rue be introvert but she be to concerned with her own life to be observant of other and I mean I do not blame she cuz she need to focus on get her shit together or even care about the life of her per that be not jule or posibly even lexi even though she pay my girl dust lol whenever rue be narate her own part though I like it and it make sense since she always seem like she be in her own little world I think lexi would be a good narator cuz it just seem that she be always take a backseat and observe everything that be happen outside of herself even in the very little interaction we have with she she seem that with each scene she be recognize the change and shift of those around her it would be col to see from the perspective of someone who discover with each step that the people she know about be go through dark time it would alsobe col to see a perspective from a teen who feel out of place with what her per be at now and what they be do and imagine how good the scene would be where she introduce we to rue it would be amazing",
          "lexi break my heart because she s the person who I relate to the most everyone else in the story have something major go on in their life that consume they lexi doesn t have the type of issue that atract attention she s just lonely she try reach out to rue by check on she in the bathrom she ask kat what she s do on her phone initiate conversation and kat brush she off consume with her personal issue the other character only talk to she when they need something from her I need a favor or how do this outfit look she longingly look at rue and jule together and I get that feel completely she want the good for her friend and really care about her but care isn t enough rue doesn t feel a conection with she unfortunately lexi have open my eye in a lot of way and we aren t even halfway through the season I m really thankful for her character",

          "I think in episode one rue say cassie be young than lexi maybe I misheard that but gia be definitely not in high school she be probably in the th grade rue mention in se that gia be when she find rue unconscious when she overdose and the show be curently les than a year after that so gia be at most",
          "the hate for mckay be real I be a male so maybe I can relate with he more and I think a lot of people forget how he defend cassie in the first episode in front of nate say she be col and how she like car mckay be a good guy hope next episode show that",
          "good cassie be much more thre dimensional than some of the other character like nate or kat at this point",
          "who the hell be say it s for a good reason I don t see how this equate to that anyone who look at any depiction of cheating and doesn t understand why cheating be bad have their own problem there s nothing this show can do diferently to change those mind only other way to show it be have their relationship be completely normal and then cassie cheat which happen plenty in real life but doesn t make for great tv or have mckay imediately find out and have cassie end up in an even bad spot and for all we know he do find out in the finally",
          "there be no evidence to sugest that nate know about kat at all and there be no way he be responsible for mckay s haze that be just what frat do",

          "if someone act in such a maner they should not bring other people into it that be plain rude though to answer your question about mature character I believe ali be a perfect example of a mature individual while I understand your disagre with my sentiment I can not ride along with your description of he be some helples victim it be almost sily to believe that mckay s image would be uterly obliterate by a guy nate whose young than he just for publicly make it know that he be date some girl who have a past clean than his private",
          "yea you can be a senior and have class with freshman over here",

          "I just realize cassie and maddie be sister I be slow lol but now I be confused how old the student be at first think they be all junior but now I be think they could all be spread as sophomore to senior they be not twin right it be an extremely smal window of oportunity to have two child so close in age they be in the same grade so I do not think they be that would also make rue young right",
          "mckay doesn t seem to awful but his smirk twin brother be awful",
          "this be my understanding of the character age cassie I think be in grade place she betwen age I could have swear she be reference as lexi young sister not old I kind of rue lexi jule maddy likely in th grade age be nate I would go with he be in th grade as most of the other character or th grade although I believe there be more reference towards colege mention more often with he make I believe he could be a senior so age wise kat I get the same feeling that her character be in the same position as nate with she could either be in th grade or th my reasoning for th grade be more deal with the hoking up with those guy that she do in the pilot the reasoning for th be sumer school with jule if she be in th grade then she the young of that group kat s hokup th grade gia th grade age just for future reference grade and age vary base on the state for cut off point and ocasionaly the school school district matter as well so for an example state m have a cut off for a kid bear betwen december december could be admit for class while in state t the time frame be september august for class",
          "oh I understand it but out of my understanding come contempt I know for a popular jock with a pretty weak sense of self he simply have to chose his rep over cassie but it make he an ashole who be old enough to know well she be ride or die with he at that party and he say he love her he s a dick",
          "what about daniel the one who tell cassie she be \" fucking dumb \" and \" fucking boring \" I be scared of dude like that he be very crepy especially dres up as te bundy",
          "you be right maybe she feel presure to be the good daughter in comparison to cassie and also I think it be intense the way rue blow she off use she for the drug test when lexi be under the impresion they be good friend there be definitely something brew",
          "I think rue mention be in junior year she go to preschol with lexi and nate in midle school and I think she say they be in the same year so they re all together lexi have an old sister cassie and cassie seem to be friend with maddie b and kat so I asume they be senior but now I m think only cassie be I figure something more concrete be state in the show I m forget so I d ask",
          "mckay be literally so short what be you even on about lmao",
          "I like kat s story because it highlight the bulshit that be basically all about serve man s boner disguise as female empowerment it isn t empower to equate your worth to get man off we be fed this on a world wide scale and kat s story perhaps somewhat subtly shed light on the reality of it this female empowerment be damage to woman and girl everywhere",

          "I like cassie so I would probably put she above cat but besides that I pretty much agree with you I can see why other might not like she though weirdly I also kind of like maddie but since she be lie to put an inocent in jail I can not say she deserve any high on the list ethan be my absolute favorite but I get why he can not be number one because fez and rue really be the show stealer I be way to obses with this show lol",

          "still not quite clear why nate tell jule his name be tyler I read that as he try to somehow ruin tyler or jule life even far since he s so calculate and evil",
          "oh I like how you go off of the trailer I don t think rue and jule be go to completely stop be friend but I think the relationship aspect of it may be close to an end as jule seem overwhelmed by the presure it s put on her but I do believe they ll be able to stay friend and there win t be any bad blood I think it be fez with the gun as well but I have no posible idea how he could get out of the shit he s in with the cop at the end of episode I hope maddie break up with nate for good but with how turbulent their relationship be I don t really know if she do leave he though I m concerned for her safety for obvious reason I believe rue be in the hospital for the kidney thing as well as she be in really rough shape last episode",
          "rue and jule ' relationship be not necesarily forbid but nate and maddy s certainly be cassie and chris ' relationship also have a secretive nature to it all despite or because of cassie s unintentionaly public past kat and ethan also have paralel to r j a misunderstanding separate they until it be almost to late so I think it be probably rash to jump to conclusion like that rue and jule will die a tragic death in s but I definitely would not rule out tragic death entirely",
          "nate be not a good person at all",
          "maddy kat and nate be pretty col",
          "I think she be talk about the situation with nate I think they will be fine relationship wise the past episode be the turmoil for their relationship the cast ship they I have see multiple interview of hunter say she want more rule next season which mean they end on relatively good term",
          "lol I actually love nate on this show it make everything so interesting",
          "nate die rue kill he because he be atack jule she hide and folow jule when she go to met \" tyler \" that be why at the begining of her narative in the first episode she introduce nate and say she never really have a problem with he and that if jule do not go see nate s dad this would not have happen anyways I be call it",
          "I do not think so because this show could kep go and I kind of hope it do that limit it severely and lead to predictable ending as after episode you re already predict it you could be right who know crepy nate dad s voice but selfishly I hope your wrong",
          "I think nate threaten she or hit her and cal overhear there be a clip in the promo and maddy be a mess perhaps lead to a beat down where he have nate pin on the ground",
          "now I know you be tell lie that manequin be not maddy it be not even when they be shot",
          "I really don t think he will I think nate s dad comit suicide be go to happen",
          "all I know be someone be getting shot next episode",
          "I be look at the on demand menu on my tv and I see the episode description for next week it say something about rue help jule take nude for shyguy do anyone think that nate might use these picture to blackmail or humiliate jule in retaliation for what she do at the party",
          "I hope she doesn t because she might go to jail but if so I think she should shot he outside homecoming while everyone s dancing and they should play replay",
          "yeah they need to show some more dimension with nate because this be just get stupid",
          "true but at the same time nate threaten she about the whole thing so I be sure she be still shake up about it",
          "he be in the app to bait her he likely know his father use it as you say he wasn t use his own picture in the app which I think he would have if he be plan to actually hok up with a guy on top of that he actually love maddy he s obviously upset about she be with tyler when they break up",
          "honestly rue do seem to have genuine feeling for jule however I feel like that win t jule reciprocate those feeling friend zone her jule do really like nate I feel like nate just use maddy for sex and his internalized view on his sexuality which be hard for he to be self aware to come to term with it it can go either way though",
          "nate fansthat s like be a fan of ramsey bolton lol",
          "I completely forget about the interview I do not see episode s interview yet anyway I think you have some really good point when she be look stres I asume it be because of how much rue depend on she and how she might have to break it off I completely forget about nate s threat I should have see that she be clearly stres when rue try to talk about the situation",
          "I think that jule will find out that nate be just play she have no intention of a real relationship she will then turn to this new group of lgbtq friend and start to somewhat pul away from rue which cause she to become more upset nate and maddy be off again but maybe he admit to she something about his dad or his colection of dick pic maybe maddy see jule and his dad fight or talk at the carnival and put together and confront he they for sure will have to deal with the falout from tyler s beat I just don t see that go away I think it s his dad hold he down but I don t think it be an asault of any kind maybe he have an outburst at home and his dad have to restrain he look like kat dive deply into her cam stuff and push ethan away I think the shot we see of mckay at the pres conference be the intro to his episode it look like it be he comit to play fotbal at whatever colege he be at now base on interview and episode description look like he have a homosexual experience or start experiment with man and be confused about his sexuality which be only make bad by the fact that cassie be pregnant",
          "and yes I agree I just get triger by some nate fan who be a bit weird because I have see abuse first hand and yes I know it be a tv show and it be so good I just do not like the weird obsesion over nate",
          "never think I would let anyone or anything do this to I voluntarily hope to survive till season",
          "well one of the brother be aron lol",
          "I think what he really need be someone to sort through his issue with and for someone to truly understand he in his curent past relationship he have be very closed and I think he need someone to break through I think he also need someone to discus his sexuality with and this need to be a boy as they will fully understand the implication and efect of the toxic masculinity and barier kep he from discus it I would like to see he fully explore his sexuality in season thre and maybe even get a boyfriend I think many other character in the show will have question about why he feel so target by lexi s play and what it mean in term of he I feel like his sexuality be mess up by his dad but with he be arest and leave the house nate will not have to feel confine by the same restriction his dad have and he will have mire time to reflect on himself rather than cary the burden of his dad s secret",
          "I be go to she doesn t deserve shit after what she do to tyler and likely also know or at least suspect something about jule blackmail she s not a toxic spouse as much as nate be but she s still a horible person",
          "I feel like everyone be take the I never mind nate until all the shit with jule to mean that he harm jule which be posible but could it mean that maybe they have some kind of positive ish relationship maybe that end in heartbreak but no violence that cause rue to resent nate",

          "this be actually a theory I be work on like people who be in a manic state never get everything right so nate do not kill jule or rue because what if this whole story be rue be paranoid",
          "it be weird because nate show both psychopathic and sociopathic tendency sociopath tend to be more impulsive violent and be product of their upbringe environment but they be capable of empathy guilt and build meaningful relationship with other psychopath be calculate sometimes but not always violent and it be consider to be more of an inherit personality disorder they be extremely good at fake emotion to fit in with other but do not actually feel guilt or remorse for their action we have not see much of cal so far but he seem to be just as manipulative and control as nate minus the physical violence part",
          "the only valid nate ship be nate prison nate a good ass whopin or nate death",
          "I think cal know that nate have the tape of jule and he never say anything to his son because he feel like he have not the right because he feel guilty about all the thing he do and how because of he nate be how he be or maybe a part of cal think that nate maybe do not know about his secret but I do not think so",

          "I ll share a thought of my own then it s roughly on the same train of thought xb the scene where nate back the statutory rapist dude into the wall and make he get on his kne make basically everyone watch I imagine think nate be about to make the guy suck his dick instead he beat the shit out of he mercilesly rather than sucumb to his internalized homo bisexual desire the hyper masculine side of he his external makeup lash out against the internalized version of himself that he hate and overcompensate by do the hyp masculine thing beat the shit out of the guy it be esentialy a crosroad where he have the choice of let his internal desire manifest themselves in real life or continue to play the part of the hyper masculine alpha male and he chose the later you note that he say you rape she you fucking fagot which seem completely random and likely untrue consider the guy have sex with maddy nate be project himself onto the guy he be beat up and lash out against he get increasingly violent and agresive as he say this because he s try really hard to fight against the version of himself he hide from the rest of the world the fact that he s look to hok up with jule and other trans girl pretty much afirm the fact that he s not totally straight",
          "that be maddy",
          "yea I think so to as he would have issue but the level of anger he have his father be pretty clearly molest he that plus the fact that there be a mis kid from the family photo and the other brother be pretty mesed up to point to classic sign of abuse",

          "nate and maddy finally realize they weren t mean for each other I think that be do pretty well I also like cassie just want to be her own person for a while like that but man the rue scene and closure be frustrating I get they want to be creative but that be bs",
          "yeah I definitely agree I don t think jule have ever have a real romantic relationship so that couple with all nate bulshit be freak she out",
          "I don t think rue be able to actually kill nate I think she ll come up with something else",
          "it seem as if you go to the deranged side of that ship lol I low key think that they d be a good couple only if nate genuinely change and act right right now I want jule far away from he even if she s conflicted about her feeling towards he they build a legit conection online and it s clear that there be some unresolved feeling on both part thank to jule episode halucination now jule be try to figure out how nate and tyler can co exist in the same body be the same person and she be go through it it d be interesting if they continue explore those feeling that down the road in season but as of now nate need juvie and some intense therapy xb I feel that the only reason why nate s act like this be because that s all he know even his damn dady admit that his behavior can indirectly be impact his son and even mention at how rageful nate be and how he be probably the reason for that behavior nate wasn t bring up in a home where you feel that you could be open about your emotion and he be also bring up in a household that engage in toxic masculinity xb so when jule come along and he start to feel something for her he lash out because that s all he know how to do he can t nobody can control their feeling he may feel conflicted because jule doesn t fit into a conventional box and he may be ashamed of have some feeling for her so instead of alow himself to feel whatever he s feel towards jule he d rather try and control his feeling by act against they xb right now as I state before jule need to stay far away from he even if she be draw to he due to her feeling I also hope that maddy realize his abuse for what it be and losen his grip that he ha son her nate need to get some serious help because none of his action be okay period however acknowledge that there be some feeling there betwen those two character isn t ship they that s just acknowledge a fact and want to see where that could go only if he change his behavior",
          "I like your theory but I do not think he be molest as a child I think he have develop in his sexuality in this way because he be watch his dad s video as a young child see his only link to manhod have sex with man but also be in a mariage with his mother more than likely confuse he he grow up watch these home video like a tv series he know his dad secret code of organization and from what they show we he be fixate on the film that involve man could be all of they so as he grow up in a hyper masculant way he know he would be subject to ridicule for have curiosity and atraction toward man so he hide that part of himself that be until he met jule she alow he to play both side of the game at the same time its his way of mainte his straightnes and taste the forbiden fruit that be my idea anyway he have psychological impresion from watch his dad and want to explore that part of himself this could explain his psychotic outburst as well because even though his dad have a bunch to lose he go about his interaction with jule in a teary eyed way versus nate say ill black mail you because I can not have you his dad have a release he doesn t",
          "I think nate go to kill jule",

          "yep I be very interested to learn more about cal I think a lot of we asume he be violent due to the violent sex and how fuck up nate seem to be but I wonder if he be actually an efective father because he \" live out his life in hotel room \" like he mention to jules whereas so far nate be unable to engage in those desire and instead turn to anger and physical agresion by asault tyler",

          "I completely agree with jule and nate have some kind of conection I think dep down nate admire jule because of how confident she be in herself nate seem to be at a loss when it come to ask himself the question he need answer to regard his sexuality also there be a scene in episode I think corect I if I m wrong where the scren be split in two with one half of jule on the left side and the other with nate and I think this symbolize their conection with each other I m think about jule s confidence and nate s lack thereof very interesting inded",
          "she should break into his house and beat he senseles like he do to tyler I would not stop watch that scene no clue what music but it should be badas hip hop track",
          "well no we already see one of nate s brother aron and all thre of the boy be around the same age and ashtray be like so no",
          "I be wonder this as well although I be still try to figure out if people on that app can see each other s face or not in other word be nate cat fishing jule to cause harm or do they both just click with each other through the app because they honestly like each other from the image they each curently have up on the app",

          "to point number one I think nate have create this list of atribute of his \" ideal \" woman as a reaction formation against his atraction to the man and trans woman he have see in his dad s video he be create this schema of what a woman he be atract to \" should \" be with every typicaly \" feminine \" quality imaginable tenis skirt fresh pedicure no body hair slend shoulder long leg thigh gap feminine voice feminine body language because be with the ideal feminize woman will \" prove \" to he that he be not atract to man or to trans woman then when jule come along and actually tick all of these box as a trans woman his atraction to her awaken his internalized homophobia transphobia and subsequent fear rage self hatred his atraction to even the most \" feminine \" of woman be no long safe to he and he snap",
          "tony in skin uk would never do the thing that nate do he be a mischievous ashole not a malicious sociopath like nate",

          "I think it nate be go to get beatdown hard by cal I be wonder how the show be go to humanize he a little bit and I bet that s how they be go to do it in episode I think cal figure out that nate watch the tape but think back on it he actually didn t he be double check to see that they be arange in the right patern and they be because nate be methodical like that after year of sneak around but in the finale I bet cal be go to find the copy of jule nude photo and he will put two and two together he might just beatdown nate without ask any question or maybe nate get lipy either way dominantdady will be in full efect",
          "I can t peg nate or cal I know a lot of scared want to be alpha kid who be exactly like nate they huf and puf but cry in a corner if their status be ever threaten I also know quite a few adult sociopath and they also seem exactly like cal they put on a good facade but in reality they be the bad predator of they all wolf in shep clothing the juxtaposition of both character confuse the hell out of I and make it hard to peg either as a sociopath",
          "all of this be why I think nate be the most interesting character in the show so far something I definitely didn t expect i think he would be the typical crush ber can against head bro but it be refreshing to see a jock character coly calculate a take down rather than just punch tyler the first chance he get add to the fact that his father be a fucked up presence in his life make he a lot more complex than I think he would be",
          "tomy genesis s album energy persona pretty much embody everything about maddy lmao and they use her feature on episode",
          "I see a pic that jule kis someone but that guy do not look like nate hope she can end up with rue they be so swet and cute",
          "a very good read that show the realism in the nate jule story line I believe this rue jule nate story line be the primary drive force of euphoria s plot and I love it",

          "there be woman who actively want to fuck serial kiler why be you surprised people ship nate and jule",
          "there be a lot of comment of people support nate and jule in this subredit",

          "I think a lot of people have hear by now that the pilot script originaly have rue reveal she kill nate I do wonder if they change their mind or if they re save that reveal for the finale xb one line that get I think be what rue say in episode one she go I never have much of an issue with nate until all the bulshit with jule when I first watch the episode I think she be adres the kitchen fight and didn t think much of it but now that this upcoming episode be hint at nate come up with a plan yeah it s very posible that he ll fuck with jule somehow and rue will hate he for it and maybe do something about it",
          "I have not find he crepy yet but I think he could get crepy real quick I would hate if that happen lol",
          "first of all english be not my first language so sorry if I say something wrong sorry if I have gramatical eror okayi be fascinating with nate and I refuse to the idea that he be only a psycho one dimensional character and I believe that be more behind the blackmail this be my theory okay jule slep with cal one week before school start it be sumer and in the same night of mckay s party she met nate in that party right one week later they start school and we can see that jule be not talk to \" tyler \" yet I do not know how be in we but I be gues school start at the end of sumer and begining of autumn and we never know in what month they be in the show we can only gues by the weather okay so when we finally see jule chat with \" tyler \" I see more kid in the school with jacket and long sleve and pant so I be gues that be be autumn spring so if I be right in this nate have wait at least two week or even a month to talk to jule it would be weird if he wait that long to start talk to she if he want from the begining to threaten she because he be scared that she could try to do something to his family ' because we can predict that nate go very often to his dad s ofice and it be obvious he see his tape with jule okay let we continue \" tyler \" send dick pic we see jule say to rue \" look his dick be huge blah blah blah \" and rue say that she do not know because be float in space okay there be no way nate would know that jule would ask for another pic compare to something to know if it be big or not let we say that she ask he for another pic next to something to know the size how nate would find the same person with the same dick with a botle I mean it can happen yes it have to be I do not know some pornstar dick what I be try to say nate feel atract to jule that be why he start talk to her he be obses with she some people say that he be in love with she but I do not think so he send his dick pic why I be say this because obviously he could not put his abdomen pic in the profile because she see his abdoman at the party but his ego be huge so if he have a nice penis he would want to show her jule nude we can compare cassie with jule in this when mckay ask cassie for her nude she do not feel comfortable and at the begining she refuse that can happen to anybody who have a bad experience like she or that be shy and in the other hand we can see that jule really want to take nude for \" tyler \" she take a lot even in the school bathrom and ask rue to help she what this say to we two thing nate do ask she for her nude or he do not ask she I would say that he do but he actually send she his pic to it be not like with mckay another thing I do not know what be wrong with nate but he do not give a fuck if someone find out his chat with jule he even talk with she in the cafeteria when he be with maddy and when he go to the shower and leave his phone and maddy find out the dick pic I do not know why he be like that someone can explain we all know that nate barely smile but when he be talk to jule he be all soft and smile sometimes like if I be try to blackmail someone I would not be all smiley and \" happy \" the dick pic we can see a lot of dick pic in nate s phone right okay if he be blackmail jule with photo of a white man why he have all type of color and size of penis in his phone I hear a theory that say he do this with all the man and woman he be dad slep with okay so how he be go to find all these people and how be he be go to blackmail those who be adult he can say he be go to kill they but then why pretend he be someone who want to fuck they first in the app what be my theory be simple he want to know how to take a good dick pic the photo with the evian botle be his that be why maddy look at that one otherwise why she would look at that one if we all know the point before maybe I be wrong with this one to be honest I be not completely sure let we continue nate fal \" in love \" with jule he actually like her and I do not think he be very happy about it so what I believe be that he do all the thing in the app to prove she that be he can be a good guy we all know this be not true but he do it because he be obses with her when in the carnival jule go to the chili stand and show rue be true that she slep with cal that be the thing that fuck up nate why he trust her he really want to met she by the lake because he think he be in love with she a brief comparison of maddy and jule before I continue when maddy say \" you be the swet guy ever \" she be say that to the violent protective nate the character I think he always try to be and he believe he have to be when he talk with jule she say \" you be so swet \" to the nate that be open and soft and actually swet that be why he say \" I feel like no one irl would ever call I swet \" because it be true no one know that part of nate okay so when jule leave the chili stand and aron ask who be her nate face omg he look to the ground and I feel like he be in \" pain \" it be the look of someone who fels betray what be I say this he feel like I say betray or vulnerable like he can not trust her like he would never expect she do something like that you may think it be not a big deal well even his dad feel threaten when they met at the lake I believe he be test her if he can trust she or no that be why he start say that he be not the person she met at the party blah blah and when she say \" can you let go off I \" he be hand be shake when he aproach she he say that he fal aslep to she and blah blah and she say she do not trust he and of course he do not trust she either look if he really hate she or whatever why would he kis her if he say the thing he say but do not kis she I would understand that he do not like she but he do to this moment she reject he thre time when she walk away from he when she ask he to let go off she and when she say she do not trust he okay so why nate would say nice thing to she and kis she if he do not like she and even when he be blackmail she he be say that be she be smart she have a big heart that be he be generous and when nate blackmail she I be really confused because she never show sign that she could want to ruin nate s family but then I realize that she actually do when she go to the chili stand what I be try to say the thing about that he link she to child pornography be a lie he probably make that up moment before when he see she in the chili stand he tough she be not trustworthy we all know that she do not like what she do that it be only to show rue that be she be not lie but nate do not know that so what I be scared of be that something can happen with jule and nate I be go to be honest ' till episode I think the only one obses be nathaniel I think jule already forget he like it pas a couple of month because be halowen but in the party when in her halucination she see nate I be like wtf I know love do not fade away just like that but he do a lot of shit he blackmail she and he make she give a false testimony and she still in love I want to say a last thing I kind of understand maddy and jule I never be in a abusive relationship but I once be in love with a boy who do some fuck up thing to I and I be still in love with he and a part of I want he to change for I that be what I believe jule feel she want he to come back crawl and say sorry that he be tyler and he love she that be all that it will take to jule to forgive he and she want to have power over he I believe that jule have feeling for rue rue be good for her but we never want what be easy what love we it be not always like that but it would be realistic I really hope jule do not end up with nate because he can \" love she \" but he be really dangerous and he have some fuck up issue maybe I be look to dep in this situation but I do not know please tell I what you think",
          "neither rue or jule be die it be way to soon in the series for main character to die plus hunter and zendaya literally say they can not wait to come back for season I do think jule will get hurt in the season finale though",
          "I think it will be fez jule or nate",
          "there be a leak photo of who gets shot on this page",
          "I really hope rue ok and that jule set shit straight with they and doesn t hurt rue I hope tyler be free because he be inocent and that nate gets serve by fez and he do not get in trouble and that kat be ok and stop talk to crepy dude that will not even show their face and bee nice to ethan and that maddie dump nate and get a restraining order and that cassie and mkay work through everything and that lexi do not feel to hurt and sad",
          "I mean tyler get himself in this mess why be a year old at a year old house party",
          "you know something that add more complexity to nate s character that I be not sure if they be try to write but this be how I interpret it be the scene where he flip and tell jule that he bait she all along I wonder if he actually do really like she and conect with she and be able to expres his emotion in a way he be not able to with anyone else he still have this jock persona and strength he need to show when he be see but behind the texting he could actually talk anonymously behind a scren and be who he want to be then when jule for good reason reject he he sudenly lose the only person he feel like he could talk to so he imediately revert back to his old way of cope with his emotional insecurity by proces his emotion through intimidation to apear strong when he feel weak that coping mechanism can be see at the pol scene when maddy be hok up with the guy in the pol he see her yel at her go to pound alcohol break thing and intimidate people then he chalenge jule be at the party because he do not want people to see that he be the one be reject he want someone else to be the focus of the rejection he want to maintain his image that he be a strong person that be how he deal with insecurity I really think that scene be more complex than just he be fake it the entire time I think that be a real part of who he be he just have to hide it when he feel threaten to I what cement it be he show up really excited and talk about how she be all he can think about and how that be who he want to be but can not then when she reject he he revert to who he have be and go with his backup plan because he be so afraid to be himself it let we he apear that he be just pretend so that he do not have to admit that he be that person jule fal in love with",
          "she s definitely fuck up because her life be on nate s hand and she can t tell rue or anyone else about it I don t think it have anything to do with be into rue or not she avoid kis she at the dor because she have alcohol breath but at the party she wasn t shy away from physical contact",
          "totally agree about the bait jule and dick pic but why be he on the app in the first place I could be answer my own question here if nate know his father use the app to I still think there be other hint of he hide any aspect of himself that be not hyper masculine and if he be gay that would be he deny something that be actually true but if he be not it be clear he do not even want to be think of as even posibly be gay and the people gosip about it they make a big deal about it so I gues my big question be what be the show say about how we talk about guy even posibly be gay",
          "nah i d rather see jule and nate now that would be a good romance arc",
          "the only reason why he be do that be because he think that jule have it out for his family yes it be horible but in his mind he be justify I feel as though if that confrontation betwen jule and cal at the chili stand during the carnival then nate would not feel as incline to blackmail her he distrust she because he fels betray by her he be start to build this conection with her and to he that all came crash down when he discover what happen with she and his dad be I justify his action absolutely not I be look at it from his perspective",
          "totally agree the way rue describe depresion hit I in the feel man I be scared for fez each episode nate weigh down on my nerve I can not stand he",
          "that be what I have be think to especially since he see his dad recording he probably think that be normal",
          "potentialy unpopular opinion I want nate to stick around on the show because he be such a fascinating character for the record I think he be a horible human being I just want to know more about what make he tick I be sure most of we would agree the short answer be privilege he be what happen in the darkest timeline of be a rich atractive straight white man except be he all those thing I find the topic of nate s sexuality on the show really interesting there be plenty of evidence to sugest he be gay be on the gay date app in the first place his obsesion with dick avoid they in the locker room ask maddy about tyler s dick size etc that say there be enough plausible deniability that he could be a pure sociopath and all these thing be plan but I think the show be try to say that some of these behavior be learn and not inate which lead I back to his sexuality whether it be actually true or not the character gosip about nate be gay and to an extent nate s aware of this jule say so to his face and this be the interesting part nate posibly be gay be the only time the character make a big deal about someone be lgbtq most of the main character be sexualy fluid I think it be a great thing really we do not belabor the fact that rue be date a girl or that jule be tran that be so refreshing but for nate the character still gosip about his sexuality and I think that play into his mis conception of masculinity that be it be shameful to be male and quer or even perceive as quer to nate it be a weaknes and it exacerbate his sociopathic personality sorry for the long think piece y take on a character that be not exactly a fan favorite and maybe this be obvious to you all already but I would love to get your take what be your read on nate s sexuality would he be gay make he more interesting do any of this even matter",
          "I think the skype guy be go to haras kat as well also I wonder if maddie will end up find out the truth about jule to",
          "but would rue get in trouble for it nate doesn t know that she help she take the picture",
          "in the original pilot script rue say she murder nate",
          "as a reminder here s a list of those who have have their early life story sharedruemadynatekatjulescasiechriswho s mis from this list and need to get their life story show during the last episode for I I always want nate s dad to have his life story share but it doesn t seem likely",
          "I don t think it can because it look like selfie but since rue help they be a term like faux selfie profesional selfie so I doubt this can hurt rue lawfuly since jule would have to rat she out as well",
          "I swear if nate end up kill rue in the finale which I be very scared for I will only watch season to see he get what he deserve I love jule but rue be my favorite and since I have hear the theory about she die I have be very scared",
          "he show his very white torso",
          "in episode rue explain about nate s father and his porn habit the fact that it have not yet come out to the character in the show mean most of this will have to be expose at some point to I this be the big hint that it be all about to hit the fan and eventualy come out",
          "usualy the one that seem the strong be struggle the most maybe lexi botle s it up like mckay but have well emotional inteligence maybe lexi will snap and she will kill nate",
          "yeah and even when she mention nate s dick pic it be because lexi tell she that be what she say so she be not completely an all know narator",
          "remember when rue talk about what nate like about woman and what he do not in the first episode I notice that jule match a whole lot of the thing that nate say he like about woman probably do not matter much to the whole story but I think it be interesting",
          "yes I read it I be sorry I be closed minded to the idea of someone date an abusive blackmailer like the humanizing of nate be just to much he be ruin people s life and I will not even play around with the idea of he and jule be even remotely in play as a relationship",
          "see but the thing about rule be why start the relationship to end it after two episode and after last episode I think jule be in a place that she want to explore that relationship beyond friend and to many of the cast ship they for they to end right now but eventualy they will end and same I be woried maddi gets kill or at least shot at the end fez situation be a lot they have like pil botle so I wonder what happen but he be definitely out and about in the last episode",
          "you re right about nate s obsesion with jule another prof of this that you leave out be that in episode rue say that during nate s indefinite suspension he would check in on maddy and check in on jule but most importantly he would watch jule house at night which I think be super weird but what I really want to know be where this obsesion lead to and the thing you say about he trust jule before the chili stand confrontation be also right because I also have the same question of what if jule didn t confront cal at the chili stand would thing have go diferently because clearly it be the confrontation that make he snap you could see the disapointment and angst in his face when jule leave he trust jule he think jule be threaten his dad not know that she have no bad intention and she just want to prove to rue that she inded slep with cal that explain why nate kis jule before he start to blackmail her he definitely have something for her but he just have to put all that behind to protect his family he s still a psycho thoand no one really know why he have a bunch of dick on his phone",
          "fezco go to nate s house to colect his money probably tell he that mouse will kill they if they do not which cal give to he cal confront nate about how all of his bulshit have ruin the family and cost they a ton of money masterade have to be someone that kat know because why would they alter their voice and hide their face I do not think it be ethan or cal like a lot of other people on here seem to think maybe one of the twin cassie get an abortion and she and mckay break up I do not think nate die my bet be on maddy cal or fezco rue relapse and have another near death experience",
          "why be I the one who want to know if lexi hok up with nate s initial date its not even important I just want to know",
          "yeah she be in love with tyler but know it be nate so his image be haunt her she be confused and traumatise that they be the same",
          "I think nate have be mess with jule and be plan to hurt she in some way or another from when she flip out at he publicly at that party there may very well be a bit of represed sexual issue towards she that make he want she yet hate she at the same time for how he feel but his main plan be also revenge see how he atack that guy who slep with his ex same type of deal he do thing in a crepy almost sexual manor perhaps will become a kiler later in his life he d be the guy who would slep with a guy then beat he up or bad afterwards everything he do be calculate and plan he do not come acros she by acident online and be plan something bad all that be say I believe if your theory on rue kill he be acurate its probably bcs he do something to jule so rue retaliate in her defense or out of her love towards jule which I see come",
          "nate say \" you drop out of high school at \" or something like that that must mean he be at least or and you all ship he with rue",
          "rue and jule be in a relationship say relationship have sufer because of nate s action therefore rue be afect by it not to mention that jule be her friend and she just want nate to leave she the fuck alone whether or not she and jule remain in a relationship fez know that rue be in a manic state he know that she sufer from mental ilnes and that she be recently sober he know that she be not think clearly and he know that it be a stupid idea he chose to confront nate on his own rue be not force he to do anything",
          "or they get togetherand rue be jelous of it and nate try s to hurt rue and that be when jule relize that nate be evil and get together with rue",
          "just a theory but maybe rue know the way she look at nate and at jule show that she realize she must have be blackmail involve with nate what do you think",
          "rue and lexi as detective find gia carousel scene rue take fentanyl rue walking on wall jule dance in the club fly I to the mon scene nate jule side by side text scene leslie monologue at na the cast leave their house to go to the prom fez threaten nate jule and rue tripingrue be manic at fez s house transition into depresion",
          "prime example of this nate s episode introduce the concept of maddy lose her virginity she present to we how important it be for nate to take her virginity only to confirm two episode later that maddy absolutely be not a virgin when she and nate hok up for the first time and that she say it for his sake even with the posibility of the \" guy in his s on a beach \" story not be true and actually something rue make up by maddy s delivery of \" no \" and \" none but my own \" you could tell that she be half heartedly try to work he over so for it to reveal two episode later it may not entirely come as a surprise or come completely as a surprise depend on where you stand",
          "I think you make good point and I agree with you I also think that nate be curious to see what his dad like about have sex with tran girl or young gay man he want to understand his dad and what he enjoy about it his dad have be hide this and project this white midle american I do not know dream or reality when that s not the case at all I think he want to understand his dad more be I make any sense",
          "true I don t think that will actually happen I m not sure who will die if anybody do pray its not jule or fez",
          "she want to scare nate and fez say that be stupid he try to have a chil conversation with nate but when that wasn t posible he threaten his life that be his choice his action not rue s fault at all she didn t force he to do anything in fact she be easily talk out of her idea because fez think it be stupid",
          "nate doesn t die in episode he s list in the episode description for and",
          "I don t know why you re apologize we could use a lot more think piece y take around here I think your take be spot on so first I have to credit the showruner and jacob elordi s portayal because they have truly leave the question of his sexuality ambiguous and open to multiple interpretation I myself have go back and forth and change my mind but here s my curent theory base on what we ve see within minute of met nate for the first time it be establish that he be interested in jule sexualy when he catcal her and run she off the road so there s also always be a thread of violence in the way he treat she next time they met be the iconic kitchen scene I m not joke give both jacob and hunter all the award for their performance in this scene what still kind of mystifie I about this scene be the amount of agresion nate display towards this skiny pretty blond girl even if he be drunk and angry what kind of guy would act like that that lead I to believe he somehow pick up on the fact that jule be tran I don t think he s find she on the app yet or maybe he have even though she pas because she start her transition early he s be watch enough of his dady s tape to pick up on the very subtle sign below all of this agresion though be an undertow of well sex the way he say he want to give she some attention while he be way to close for comfort he be literally breathe down her neck it s honestly kind of rape y their whole dynamic be so fuck it but fascinating ok next time we see they together be another iconic scene at the lake again give hunter and jacob all the award he be not there to simply reveal his blackmail plan and entrap jule it take I a lot of time to try to figure out his motivation for kis she he didn t have to do that but he felt compel to because he definitely be sexualy curious about jule I think the fact that his dad who I think he love but also kind of despise for put his family s reputation and position at risk fuck her first make he super curious interestingly enough one thing the show hasn t mention be whether or not nate be arouse when watch his dad s porn other clue how angry he become when jule call he a fagot he have all kind of dick on his phone beyond the dick from white guy he would need to catfish jule why he do seem to have a genuine sexual conection with maddy although I think he get a lot more satisfaction out of their fuck than she do my conclusion I think nate be mostly straight posibly bi he doesn t really know his own sexuality yet because he be still a tenager still try to figure thing out watch his dady s tape and posibly be arouse by they really mess with his head perhaps he have all the dick on his phone because he be try to figure out where on the spectrum he actually fal the fact that he be physicaly atract to jule complicate matter even far and also scare he to death he think be gay be a very bad thing because his dad can t be open about it and he be to ignorant to understand that be atract to a pretty stylish blond girl who just happen to be tran doesn t really make he gay",
          "I feel like nate say you rape she you fucking fagot while beat tyler up because of his dad he be definitely release his anger towards his dad onto tyler when nate watch his dad video as a kid I bet that he think it be rape I feel like this make little to no sense lol",
          "rue how d it go with tyler jule he didn t look like his picture",
          "maddy be dance with mckay",
          "I do not know about nate be col but I would say he be a pretty interesting character",
          "prediction rue die nate and jule somehow go to end together on s or in the case that rue do not die maybe they will end up together in s but I do not think so the skype guy be go to haras kat maybe threaten she with her nude maybe nate s go to jail but I do not think so mckay go to lose his shit maybe he will brake up with cassie because he feel really pres with all the thing about fotbal maybe maddy leave nate and this time for real maybe she find out about the thing with jule sorry if my english be bad",
          "daniel above anyone not name nate I can t agree with that at all ruefirst of all how dare you",
          "I agree though I think that since base on what he say at atx festival rule seem to be base on sam levinson and his wife s relationship what will probably happen be that they ll grow into a more adult version of their curent dynamic",
          "I m totally with you that it be a bad rash decision but on the other hand I think fez really do care about rue like a sister and no matter what state of mind she s in something nate have do have she so fuck up she s talk gun I think he s take the oportunity to be protective of she regardles of what the circumstance be and nate be not a pushover so he amp it up from some minor intimidation to a death threat smart logical or reasonable no understandable yeah I can see why he make that jump",
          "just want to get some opinion on it her character be do good except now she have no agency when she have to ask mr white gangsta to take out nate",
          "I gues you be right I just see nate as a pos",
          "yeah I definitely think nate will have to die by the end of the season because he be by far the most unlikable character on the show I think at most everyone can see where the rot of his problem be but I doubt anyone watch the show like he as a person or support he because of be the least like on the show how a lot of the subplot link back to he and the fact that he s very iredemable I feel like there s no choice but to kill he off it sort of remind I of the season finale of big little lie to spoiler because by the end pery be so unlikable and iredemable that it have to happen",
          "also not to mention the way cal talk to that one guy in the motel about hide his sexuality and if he think it afect his kid even if they do not know about it I think that could be use to reference nate and how its afect he and his sexuality because he s a direct image of his dad even to the point of kep it hide know his dad do not even acept himself he be secretly homophobic towards his dad and therefore have issue acept himself as well",
          "what about cal be there suicide",
          "you nate and jule shiper be weird how could she posibly have feeling for he he be blackmail her she have feeling for tyler the person he be pretend to be he just about lie about everything he tell she when he be tyler so she obviously do not have feeling for nate she love rue and care for she deply so uh yeah there be more than just friend feeling for both of they if you have be in an abusive relationship then you know an abuser do not really have feeling for the person they abuse they love to control they nate be a sociopath he be obses with the idea of control jule and hurt and control maddi this man need to be kill and or put in prison",
          "kind of hope she will rue out with her addiction and her relationship with jule since jule be go to be part of the brewing nate drama",
          "at this point every character will have comit statutory rape at some point nate s dad seem like he s go to be the only one really go to jail for it though with his video recording and internet and shit",
          "when do she say she d still fuck nate I mis that",
          "I be think this as well it would be the much col twist I think jule panic and reject he when he reveal himself as nate rightfuly so which would explain all the crying after the carnival that we see in the trailer jule perfectly fit his ideal girl list that the show go to great length to describe for some reason he damn near murder tyler over maddie he s clearly get some unresolved issue with his dad I think he find the dad s video of jule and go apeshit",
          "cal jacob be in season episode he go back to the bar he say he have not be to in year the last time he be there he be when he be nate s age during the flashback scene of he dance with his then good friend at the bar a bit of math would reveal cal would therefore be exactly",
          "I agree that nate be slip into comic vilian teritory but the whole jule never really show recipocation interest in rue be kind of the point jule do something a lot of people do for well or for bad her heart be absolutely shit on so she go for the safe thing in front of she that s always treat she well and know for a fact be into she even if she didn t feel the same way she probably even hope think her feeling towards rue would eventualy grow change but as she s learn that s just now how it work",
          "first rue bait the na counselor and get he to back date her atendance recordnext kat threaten to bring child porn charge against anyone share she videofinaly nate make tyler admit to rape madyintereste way to weaponize a potential vulnerability just something I notice this week while watch",
          "or do he he be cal s son after all",
          "jule would have notice if tyler sometimes have a white dick and sometimes have a black dick",
          "this be a stretch but technicaly rue take most of the nude of jule I know the law can be very specific for child pornography any chance this come back to bite rue",
          "I think she ll be take as colateral by mouse or murder by nate we see already nate can t control his anger and rue threaten his livelihod",
          "rue get depresed and watch straight episode of a british reality show jule go to visit an old friend cassie look for advice in the aftermath of halowen night",
          "I have a feel one of the teen be go to end up dead with the past two episode I be expect nate but the bold choice be rue",
          "so do anyone think jule show full on nudity in the picture from the school bathrom I be rewatche nate s spech to she and I realize that he say she would be put on the sex ofender registry because she take nude in the school bathrom the picture that rue take of she be only half nude so I be just wonder what she show nate tyler",
          "if fez be the last episode maybe he kill nate either in defense or to stop rue from do it herself or he could take the blame for rue it may delve into his background while also put an end to his character somehow jail or whatever it have also be mention that angus cloud be literally stop on the street and ask to be in the show never have an act carer so this may make it posible for they to cary on that storyline sacrifice a smal role to take responsibility of the murder they can finish the story they start and continue rue s story in the folow season",
          "you do make a good point I have think that jule just let it happen because she be afraid and realize that tyler be a lie I figure he do that thumb thing because he learn from his dad and think that be how he be suppose to act he just do what he know and maybe jule like that consider she be interested in ' dominantdady ' I be go to rewatch that scene but I think it be one of the more complex scene of his own iner struggle of self and not know how to act I mean that line paraphrase \" if you do not trust yourself how can we trust you \" because he give she a moment to acept he but thank for your insight man this show be great",
          "I can see rue do some shit to nate and end up in a psych ward or some shit lol and that be where she be narate the story from",
          "yeah what cal say to maddy definitely aply to they as well",
          "I could understand jule be blind to the toxicity and try to have a relationship with nate but for any viewer who have see everything we have all see to dream of a relationship betwen jule and nate at this point I have serious concern about their idea of healthy relationship or their thought on someone be ability to \" change \" there be no \" fix \" nate and I know that be the trap a lot of people fal into that cause they to stay in abusive toxic relationship",
          "yeah the demonization of cal as a psycho pedo rapist by some of the show s fan be already concern enough consider all he be be a closeted gay bisexual man id hope the show would not add more fuel to the fire by legitimize those kind of take by show he comit some kind of incestual act on a young nate",
          "plus rewatche some scene you can ser nate replicate his father behaviour I think it might have something to do with that to",
          "this be probably the most acurate answer this season will obviously bled into the second that be how finale work some stuff end on a high note ethan kat other thing continue on drug addiction rule problem nate s iner demon and new plot line open up fez mouse jule cal sex tape",
          "rue statement of I ve never met anyone like jule before I feel like rue and nate share that same feeling also she know alot about nate s life but doesn t know what happen betwen jule parent which I find interesting jule just move to town rue have know nate since at least midle school it s not that weird to know more about nate than she do jule be that they just met",
          "sorry I be be hyperbolic what I mean be that when they have almost every relationship in the show have some sort of infidelity as a direct result of stres it get whack because it turn into cheat be actually okay normal as a reaction to stres it work when it s only specific character do it because then it s a part of their character it work in nate and maddie s relationship because it show how they ve get an unhealthy relationship and that s one of the aspect of it however when every fucking time there s conflict in someone s life they basically just go and fuck the near person who isn t their partner in the show it turn into a trope it take away the power from one person specificaly do it because it go from this person cheat because they get their self worth from the attention of man because their relationship be extremely unhealthy and they don t respect their partner as much as they feel lock in to their partner to this person cheat because this be the show where the writer don t know how to show self destructive behavior except through sex and then the message it send outside of just be por form when write a show be that cheating be normal behavior to deal with stres because of how realistic the show be they do not really have the excuse of well it s just entertainment because they re intentionaly make it a realistic mas market drama they show it as bad but fight club also show the whole fight club movement as bad and they still get a generation of bored something be to think that start an anarchist movement build around not get your dick wet enough be col as shit",
          "lexi and rue plot to kill nate I know that s wild but I would like to see it",
          "let I save this post and see if you be right yeah I think that rue be narate the story from beyond the grave but I like this theory well be it okay that I would not care at all if she kill nate also that guy in the picture I don t think we have met he yet",
          "he s not check I d on all these young guy and girl he s hok up with and secretly tape and that weird thing he say about jule be jailbait when he be fluster after the chili incident I m not sure why the hell he would say that to nate cal know he s have sex with probably a lot of minor who just lie about their of age so he know he s play with fire with that I be go to not the same kind of mess up as molest young kid though eta I gues it be the brother and not cal who make the jailbait comment still crepy but not bizare like if cal say it kind of skeve I out that every guy in this mess up family be check out jule though",
          "I would be surprised if nobody die I think the show have be intentionaly craft a real sense of danger with its main plot I also think for this reason that it would be at the end of this season I can not imagine this season end without serious consequence so if we be to asume somebody will die this season then who I would say obvious maybe to obvious answer would be rue in some kind of sacrifice for jule and there be a ton of hint here the first would be her omniscient naration of each character she give at the begining of each episode she do not know these character back story in story so perhaps she have this knowledge in after life the second would be she be kind of a christ figure she be frequently in church give spech in na she already die and come back to life with she od as well her conversation with the guy from na be concern as well that one scene in the diner be kind of crazy sure she be ramble but she give this almost meta comentary on every character in the show about how \" everybody be just reach for something \" then the guy tell she that \" nothing in highschol last forever \" which rue seem to disagre with especially in regard to jule rue dying would surely prove that highschol and her relationship to jule do have lasting consequence also jule be somewhat suicidal maybe rue s sacrifice for her life would be for the sake of reafirm jule s life and this be kind of tenuous but maybe rue romeo and jule juliet be star cros lover destine for tragedy I do not know what do you guy think",
          "you clearly think she s be manipulate by the big bad nate and have no agency in her own toxic action",
          "doesn t remind I of tony at all tony be a dick head but he at least care about his friend and I don t see how nate could get the university jock to do anything doesn t seem like he d know they at all and why would they do anything he say in the first place",
          "I have see a lot of theory that rue be dead and that be why she be narate or that jule may die I think there be a murder death and it s nate he be make a lot of enemy he get tyler lock away blackmail jule have maddie in a toxic relationship must likely know about kat be a webcam girl also think he have something to do with the gay hazing of mckay because he use to date cadie it remind I of skin uk except this tony have no redeem quality what do you think",
          "I honestly think that nate and jule be go to have some type of relationship I think maybe he be try to play she but I think it be go to evolve into something more when jule first visit his profile his bio say \" new to this not out no hokup look for someone something real \" I think there may be some truth to that maybe he feel like what he have with maddy be not real and he want to explore and he may also be curious about what his dad like about tran woman but if it be true he be not look to do anything sexual because he say no hokup but base on jacob elordi s interview I be not really sure because he say that jule be physicaly the problem so maybe he be try to get revenge I really hope not because I kind of ship they",
          "I be a bit confused on the scene with nate tyler do nate rape tyler after beat he up they show he get out of the shower similar to the scene with his dad and jule after they have sex",

          "to be fair she be be a wreck since nate fuck with her she be probably desperate to escape and run away and unfortunately rue got tangle up in it as an emotional casualty",
          "plus in the first episode nate be buy drug from fezco and I gues they could have sustain their relationship after split up but I do not know it just seem off",
          "I definitely see your point and I agree that people who be like nate must have the initiative in get well and prove to we that they change for the well somehow what if there be no one for they to hold on to while they redeem themselves no one who believe in they to be well know fully well that nate be unstable I think he need someone someone who will call he out and not just blindly love he like maddy lol sorry okay okay I know nate do not show what he really be to maddy so I can not really blame maddy on that but this be why I think jule mean more than maddy to nate because jule know the true nate I would like to think that somewhere in the plot jule will be able to help he be a well person because some people do not have the strong will in get it together all on their own there be people who be just flat out dangerous to be with and some who be not we do not know what they really feel and for the show to show nate s back story be significant give they the benefit of the doubt if they do not get well then there go their second chance",

          "I be gag over the th episode my heart be beat so freak fast the last minute jesus I be almost have a heart issue I be cry no I be sob I hate nate first off all idgf about his little boy issue because he be a fcking cunt gia smoking wed my jaw drop but like I can not I just can not get over the rewind of jule and rue s memory and the kis fck I need more episode how be I suppose to wait for real I know that the relationship they may create be go to end up real bad but you know what I be live the moment the moment that they love each other and need each other in order to survive I be aware that jule be go probably to hurt rue because yeah you know what I mean I be not sure they love each other in the same way",
          "yeah I think she know something be fishy betwen jule and nate she just doesn t know what it be",
          "I be pis because fez be aware that rue be in a manic state during that conversation and he do not even get a backstory to what be go on betwen rue jule nate nate just happen to walk into the store and fez take that oportunity without really think it through first or consider the fact that rue be in a manic depresive state it be a hasty thoughtles decision to call out nate in that moment and it be alitle out of left field because he seem to like to mul thing over and overthink in previous episode",
          "I think nate s blackmailing jule because he know his dad fuck she and do not want she to ruin his life and I think that rue kising jule be real but now that you mention it it could be a fantasy however they do already kis and jule do not make a big deal about it so maybe they do kis also since she come back from her date with tyler aka nate maybe she want to be comfort and kis by rue",
          "I m not point any finger at all here but we really know next to nothing about nate s old brother other than that s jailbait bruh comment about jule make during the carnivalhe seem like he might be half in the bag at the carnivalso if this theory turn out to be corect I might his brother have something to do with it",
          "I think nate be sexualy abuse by cal there be hint to it in episode when cal go into nate room in the scene after nate see the tape cal have hide there be uneasy vibe like nate be use to cal come into his room and manipulate he then nate s like and dislike be describe and he obviously have an extreme aversion to male sexuality like he have be traumatize then there be nate s agresion and the way he call tyler a \" fagot \" when he be physicaly asault he and acuse he of rape maddy there be also a strange dynamic in the jacob family like there be a secret the whole family be complicit in keping and I do not think it be just the secret of cal be gay because nate seem so angry at his family as if they do not protect he male victim of sexual asault also feel an imense amount of shame so I think nate be try to kep his family shit under wrap because he do not want everyone to find out what his dad do to he finally the way he abuse maddy and jule be like he be copy something he have see or experience",
          "what if nate be a molested child first of all I admit I be a huge rue jule rule fan but here be the clue of my theory the birthmark on his bely be repeatedly frame during his backstory in asasination nation same director sam levinson it be a birthmark that make recognisable the unknown sluty girl of the steal sex tape who have a huge colection of sex tape his father the studio be always lock and the drawer as well but we ve see a baby nate sit there wait for with anxiety but resignation his dad once again we know he hate girl act like boy and body hair he noticese maddie because she be hairles he hate naked man in the locker room but he be more shocked rather than disgusted there s a persistent look of an adult nate inside the damn studio interupt by a surprised cal and again maddie tell we there be picture of many different penis inside the nate s phone be he in contact of all his father victim if you consider this point of view jule dvd be mising because he s try to protect she before the moment those video will get out public the line how briliant be they in this serie betwen jule and nate seem to be more legit in this way I do not trust you either you be break inside you re so broken that you do not trust yourself and that be scary for you not for I all be dep knowledge of the pornography law be for this reason part of the plan something similir be in the plot of asasination nation as I say what be your opinion",
          "right now I be at the stage where I be try to get the timeline right in my different theory scenario it be a mess lol but I really really hope I be completely wrong about this and no one or just nate he can go die at all also very glad tomorow be sunday and I can get more info to overanalyze",
          "we know that this episode will revolve around cassie and rue make reference to the mistake that she have have in the preview we know that one of those mistake be that she trust someone she should not have and he take advantage of she and put out her nude and that tape I be think that tonight we might find out who the mystery man be and it could posibly have be nate I know it be kind of far fetched but hear I out we do not see the guy s face at all but so we know that the person want his i d conceal there be also something there to nate s total dislike of cassie it be kind of weird to I I know they have not interact on scren much but think about it the first time we hear cassie s name its nate put she down and try to convince mckay that she be no good I know mckay and nate be good friend but nate do not seem like the type that care so deply for a friend to be like hey she be not your type another go back to the one time they have be on scren together the carnival scene nate hardly acknowledge that she be there he basically turn his back to she and will not even look at her also cassie be very upset after with the just chilin comment maybe she be a little more upset because nate be the guy who last say he do not want to be with she and she want mckay to say it in front of he because she here be a guy that want I when you reject I its like he be go out of his way to prove just how much he do not like her as to why he would then put the nude and tape out well he be a sociopath there be nothing to show it be he and cassie have no incentive to rat he out as she hok up with her good friend man a good friend who we know would side with nate and as we have seen already threaten to destroy she when she talk about the dick pic how do you think she would react to this also just look at his mo you do not think that jule be the first person he get to send nude and thing to if he do it be cassie I think she would have be much more receptive of nate s advance this be just my theory",
          "I never say she do not want to believe that but last episode she be literally choke and slap nate while he be talk like tyler so yeah the idea of he be what she love not nate as a person she say he be a bitch and pusy and want the world to know she do not have those feeling for nate she do for tyler who do not exist",
          "or rue have to protect her jule from nate and kill he as self defense or something interesting idea",
          "his name on the app be tyler so I really think he know exactly what he be do from the start he s so machiavelian",
          "where jule cut herself to throw off nate s beat down intention I be like \" that be one bad bitch right there \" and I be hok",
          "another week another crisis avert now I be not condone cheat my heart be on the brink of explosion when mckay get close to the dor I be go to he secretly know she be back there otherwise why check the room but lexi save cassie and rue that night even after they clown she for her bob ros costume",
          "very good catch the name of the main character always remind I of romeo and juliet if this series play out like romeo and juliet somebody honorable like tybalt will die in the series finale somebody unintende probably fezco because he be honorable for confront nate",
          "the most satisfying moment be see nate get the shit out of he by jule",
          "I think he shower because he be cover in tyler blood and he have a date with maddie right after that to go bowling",
          "so I believe that this season will end with some kind of violent and traumatic event the show definitely do not shy away from explicit scene which be awesome and I feel like there have be a continuous buildup of presure betwen many of the character nate would obviously be the prime candidate to do something violent and crazy again he have clearly show his wilingnes to be violent and the early scene of he shot handgun with his dad demonstrate his aces to weapon I also believe that there be plenty of other individual that could comit an act of violence both on themselves or other I be woried that two of my favorite character jule and ethan could be injure by or comit violence jule have be put into such a terible situation by mainly nate and rue to some degre I feel like she engage in self harm or comit suicide be posible ethan who I just want to be happy could be a victim or an agresor he be a smal enough role that he could be kill off and he clearly have terible luck thus far in the show but at the same time I could see he getting fed up with kat and do something completely insane it would be unexpected and shocking come from he but the show be due for more shocking event honestly I be anxious for the next episode and I can not wait to see what happen also I could be totally off in my prediction so let I know what you think I need people to talk with about euphoria",
          "I agree I personally think nate s character be bisexual and be try to repres both his same sex atraction and his atraction to trans woman he be create these \" rule \" for who he be alow to be atract to in order to kep those side of himself repres he be deply disturb when jule met all of the specification that he create yet she be still tran",
          "same which be why I consider this one of my big oh shit moment he s that physicaly intimidate serious respected man around town with a secret that we ve see dozen of time in medium and as soon as we see he be nate s dad my imediate asumption be that cal would end up be a physicaly verbaly abusive father and that would explain nate be so fuck up and violent it s a refreshing angle",
          "seem like he s just posture his whole life have be build on what he see around he I e the rigid home life and traditional gender role of father and mother his position as captain of the team etc I feel like he doesn t necesarily want to be in a relationship or even have sex with jule so much as he want to be she or at least like she not so far as be a full trans but free to expres himself truly I mean what do he even want as a human being he doesn t seem to enjoy anything in his life on more than a superficial level his relationship with maddy seem like a job more than anything and he s only with she because she check the box this doesn t forgive the thing he s say and do especially stalk and atack tyler the most telling thing for I be when he call he a fagot in blind rage which could be a tell as the mask sort of slip in that moment",
          "his name on the app be shyguy but then he later reveal himself as tyler when jule ask his name",
          "she fuck up for sure but nate coerce she into it he threaten to ruin jule ' life so what would he do to madiehe already choke she",
          "you make several good point in this post and of course abuse be never ok and should not be romanticize at the same time life be mesy and thing be not black and white it be also at tv show a simultaneously realistic yet sureal tv show with some soap opera flair in other word let people feel how they want to feel because it be all fantasy anyway it be really not that serious we be not watch a documentary with real people so I really do not understand the need to ridicule the nate jule shiper it be not like the show have not give they plenty of material to fuel their ship after all jule the character be still somewhat conflicted about nate tyler as demonstrate in episode in she after the episode unfiltered interview even hunter schafer say she play jule as if the character still have hope that a relationship with nate could work out because he be still speak like tyler during the first half of their rendezvous at the lake at the end of episode she do not recoil from his kis until he crepily stick his finger in her mouth and that be when everything change but even after that moment of incredible heartbreak and betrayal it be would be unrealstic to expect jule ' afection for nate tyler to instantly evaporate that same expectation should aply to the nate jule shiper I mention all of this because it be clear the show be try to make some of the audience feel conflicted about nate jule I totally understand the fan who be clear eyed about the toxicity of any kind of relationship nate and jule could have I just think there be no need to claim some moral high ground above the nate jule shiper nobody want to see jule hurt if they want to fantasize or believe nate can change and actually be a love partner to jule who care like I say before it be all fantasy anyway",
          "great idea and honestly it be hard to folow for anyone I think a lot go on in those flash I just want to add that while jule be make out with nate she dominate he by gag he with her finger and tell he that he s a pusy and a bitch and she wish the whole world could know it definitely wasn t the dreamy oh but I secretly have a crush on he fantasy situation that I be woried it be go to turn into when he apear and tell she she have texte he",
          "yup he be see some shit and at certain point you figure out how the world work",
          "everyone except nate s brother",
          "yes he set maddy up in case thing don t go his way in the future true sociopath that one",
          "I see your point and as a character perhaps she just find nate to scary to physicaly confront and this take away from her agency however I think it be important to remember she be in one of her manic phase when she say these thing and she can not really be hold acountable for what fez decide to act on I recomend look up how bpd can afect interpersonal relationship if you want to explore this further",
          "you go to make I have to go back and watch it to that would be crazy if what you re say be right but nate have already prove that he do some crazy stuff",
          "no esentialy he be not he lie about everything he tell she he say he live with his mom only dad leave his family also nate be a sociopathic blackmailing abusive piece of shit like I say that scene be nate s face atach to tyler s word she love the idea of tyler while also hate nate",
          "I feel like it be definitely to early to call as euphoria go on we could find out any of those thre character be dead die I do not know if nate be go to be the vilain of this series or if he be go to through some major character development but I kind of definitely feel that sociopath vibe from he I feel like rue s infatuation and addiction will make whatever relationship they have rocky and short live I also really like rue and fez though I know there be like a chance that actually happen so I might be a little biased I personally think rue and jule and jule and nate look like it could be nothing but unhealthy at the moment jule should be with someone stable so maybe a third option introduce later in the series",
          "base of the trailer and the picture of that dol that be shot in the chest I really think it will be a random bystander that gets shot since it s fez and nate that will fight they ll acidentaly shot some random girl and be that fez will be the agresor he ll be the one go to prison",
          "no it be not it be a great vision but you can not change people someone like nate need year of real therapy with a psychologist and even then he may never be a good partner believe I I have think I could change someone I know people who think they could change someone it do not work it only destroy the \" good \" person who want to help",
          "thank you I have never say maddy be inocent her action be the result of manipulation like cm on I explain myself already thank you ana",
          "I ve literally never see a single post encourage nate jule or nate maddy",
          "rue will definitely relapse nate be either go to go to jail or die tyler s go to kill himself cassie s pregnant cal s secret will get out rue will do something to get back at nate rue and jule will end up just be friend maddy s go to turn on nate and confes fezco will get hurt or kill try to help rue rue will od again posibly on fentanyl",
          "hm I never really notice any of that stuff but rember the dude in cal s hotel in ep he s in the porn video that cal make I think so rue narative have to come into play eventualy",
          "what if rue be contemplate kill nate but lexi be the one who actually do it",
          "heyfirst of all I be a little bit obses with these two to I think the reason why they start chat long after the sex debacle betwen jule and nate dad be simple they \" met \" on a date app so I gues it take time to match in the first place honestly I have already forget the type of dickpic on nate phone I just remember the evian one and I think that the reason maddy know it be not nate dick because it be not that big unlike on the pic with the evian botle d I do not think jule have serious feeling for rue other than love she like a friend I can also understand maddy because I would been in an abusive relationship so yea and I think that nate have feeling for jule and vice versa",
          "there be no main character of each episode even when it be nate s episode we do not get much or as much as I expect",
          "I think it might be something similar to his father where they admire people specificaly tran non binary folk that be able to fully expres themselves to the world and not feel the presure to conform they then we sexual intimate relation with say person as a means to feel that fredom themselves without have to deal with that same societal backlash overali feel nate whole warped sense of sexuality and specificaly his own stem from his father lack of honesty with his sexuality and jule be unfortunate like many real life tran woman to get catch in the midle of these man s issue",
          "oh damn you and op make a really good point I just make a post on how sociopathic he seem but I think this part of the story be really important to I also really do not like nate but I now realize he may say a lot more than what one may initialy think of he maybe nate be not redemable but maybe someone irl feel the need to be as violent just from what they be teach and what people s expectation be of they",
          "she do not know that be what nate s do he probably lie to her nate s a manipulative prick",
          "that s an interesting theory and would really further the story along in an unexpected way I definitely think there be something there betwen nate and cassie when it come to nate s thought on cassie as shakespeare say doth protest to much now it could be a hokup go south or I can see it be something so smal as be reject by cassie nate doesn t seem like the type of dude who will take rejection lightly either way this would be an interesting layer to throw into the mix",
          "I see quite a few people say that nate s description of what he look for in a girl heavily match jule however hunter do an interview that she be happy to see a trans woman in a quer relationship so what be you thought",
          "I may have misunderstod it but I think that nate have take tyler s phone maybe so he could not call or maybe because he think tyler would die and want to kep up apearance on his social medium acount that he be okay and tyler be actually shyguy but I be tired and do not pay much attention to the phone I will rewatch again tomorow",
          "definitely that just let I know that he have some feeling for she in the episode synopsis it say that nate will reveal who he really be so I hope that be in regard to jule to kep that plot move",
          "agre I be scared that because jule have experience so much homophobia transphobia and violence at the hand of the man she be have encounter with that she might still be in love with nate rue be give her healthy intimacy without violence however I think she be also just use she as a substance",
          "would love to see rue and fez get that drug dealer who fed rue fentanyl rough nate up somebody s get to do it",
          "just kind of sit here think about some of the more unrealistic thing in the show and I wonder if we re go to get a twist that some of the thing we ve see be not true part of I hope no because I think that d wreck the vibe of the showbut it s totally plausible for there to be a moment where we see that like jule be never into rue as much as she d tell we or that nate be much les psychotic than we have be show I do not know the line from episode be just really look like a chekovs gun to I",
          "wait there be people that ship jule and nate have they watch the fucking show lmao",
          "I think the be high part might have make you mis the fact that jule do not know it be nate only we do and jule be atract to man aparently and so far it do not look like rue be one so that be a no at this point there I say it",
          "with season one come to an end this sunday I m curious to hear what your prediction for the finale be here s mine kat s cam stunt be about to blow up in her face because black scren guy she be chat with be ominous as shit rule be go to come to a mesy end hopefuly they can still be friend because I personally like they well like that anyway lexi be gay either nate be go to get away with everything really hope that doesn t happen or maddie be go to see the light and stop enable he to be a piece of shit not really hold my breath on that one rue might relapse I really hope not because I m rot for her someone s go to die",
          "perez gets shot jump in front of jacob maybe jacob acidentaly shot perez fez jump out the window and do the race it might be one of mouse s shoter go to kill fezco and they have some sort of shot out it s rue but she could be halucinate cal most definitely want those tape and he hold nate against the ground or cal come in to tell nate that perez be dead or injure after getting shot rue go through more withdrawal and fight with her family I do not know that s just some of mine",
          "I be think that maybe she do end up kill nate or try to and somehow end up in a psych ward or something like a mental hospital and that be where she be narate from",
          "I be sorry but I beg to disagre it be not like adopt an angry dog yes we can not change people at least be there for they be there for the one who be struggle to get well it be a real fucking slow proces it be really up to we the truth be we can leave \" nate \" alone or we can be there for he you know that be if he want I to be there if he do not then just look over at the corner lol if that person want to be well and they want someone we can be there for that person",
          "maddy identify tyler at the station at the end of the episode sure nate s manipulate she but she should definitely know well than to frame an inocent person especially because she be the one who get tyler in this mess in the first place",
          "could not have say it well jule be by all acount ideal she be feminine semingly hairles and be fully acept of who she think he be he be grow up with a father who encourage he to be the kind of man that he be with the exception of what he do behind close dor it almost feel like he be live vicariously through his son but do not realize that he be more like he than he could ever imagine nate be just as obsesive and secretive as cal but I think nate be more calculated and definitely more violent his whole understanding of sexuality and love have be warp by have a closeted father mary to a woman he probably do not love which I almost think be miror in nate s relationship with maddy in that the sex they have be very impersonal and that he be more in love with the idea of kep she saintly and safe than he be with she as a person he want to kep she around because that be how it be suppose to be and his obsesive behavior do not alow he to be okay with anything deviate from the norm I think he genuinely like jule as a person consider that he admit that she be smart and a good person when they be at the lake and I seriously hope their whole thing be not apart of some perverse fantasy in which he re enact his dad s sexual encounter although I would not be surprised if it be I do not know this whole thing be fuck I up which be of course the point but try to navigate nate s brain be so confusing lmao",
          "I think that he be already pis because of his conversation with mouse and how he be force to take that amount of pil he wasn t his normal self and I think that he snap when he talk to nate",
          "he fucking deserve to hear that",
          "I remember read an article right when all the information on euphoria be come out and it mention that rue have to deal with the falout of hurt the main fotbal player so I think rue do kill nate",
          "start out with rue flashback to rehab and her think about her father from the gif then move onto rue in hospital talk to julesthen we get winter formal where everyone confront each otherthen it be the next day and rue get into a fight with someone mabye nate and fez come to defend her then gt fez shot at nate but acidentaly hit maddy because of the manequin leak lt and the epsiode end with they disband from the scene of the crime",
          "what degre of resolution be you look for it s s of an ongoing television show listen to people bang on about this be absolutely confound nate still alive rue still an addict what be this shit it would be like people turn off soprano at the end of season and flod the internet to expres outrage that tony soprano be still a gangster and his therapy have acomplish nothing every character be in the same place they start shit finale",
          "do anyone else feel like rue be go to be the one to take nate down the cinematography at the party this episode hint at it along with how nate have nothing on she to manipulate and threaten she with jule could also do it but she would have to go for cal as an \" if I be go down I be take you with I \" sort of thing",
          "the story of the show be the event of the past month or so the show begin in late sumer jule be new in town I think school be just about to start or just start cassie and mckay have be see each other for a few month before the show begin rue od and be in a coma then go to rehab the show start when she get out this be why the show start then she be not around for anything after her od rue be likely tell the story from the end of the school year june if she be bear september she would still be in as her birthday be still a couple of month away right now we be still only in october season will end about half through school year season will cover the second half of the year",
          "I imagine think nate be about to make the guy suck his dick I totally think that be where the scene be go to feel both relieve and disapointed when I realize it wasn t",
          "omg yeah which will either give nate a rain check and he will realize that all the fucked up shit he s do be not okay or it will fuel his rage even more and he ll be act even more batshit crazy ack",

          "I think that those be all great posibility I also think that rue realize that by she go to nate directly it could actually put jule life in danger I e he would just be so angry that he would asault jule",
          "snap as in do something rash to nate",
          "that be true but rue s get there her admision that she probably should be on medication be a huge step and once they overcome their curent hurdle such as por comunication nate s hold on jule and everyone they could really blosom into something good",
          "yes one of the boy be nate and one of they be nate brother aron who be describe in the second episode as a fuck up they be literally be picture as a family father mother nate and aron the third boy be not there the third boy could be fezco but I do not know",
          "in episode one its reveal that s nate s dad hok up with jule through a family photo in the photo you see nate s dad a woman more than likely his mom and thre boy one of they be obviously nate but who be the other two boy I believe that the other two be fezco and his brother ashtray I think nate s mom find her husband s home video and divorce he leave the boy with the father I think that be what cause nate to work out so hard as a child along with find his dad video that be his way of cope with the trama I think fezco cope with it by run away drop out of highschol and start a new life with his ashtray it episode one when we first met fezco and ashtray ashtray go on to tell rue how mortgage need to be pay I think this wasn t just a joke because so far we haven t see fez and ashtray parent so I think it s safe to say they live alone lastly if you look at the family photo mention early and look at the young boy find in the botom right of the photo it might just be I but I think if you be to shave his head and give he a few face tat and he ll look just like ashtray",
          "this be the penultimate episode of the season traditionaly penultimate episode will have a lot of shit go down I m still on the boat that rue kill nate I feel that tonight we re go to get the memorial scene from the pilot script maybe next week though it would make more sense and I m almost positive the final scene of the finale will have she say the I m the one who kill he line",
          "I do not think rule will end just yet hunter say in an interview she want more rule scene next season so I be asume the show end with they on good term I agree though I think nate be do for because that be for sure fez with a gun and a mask my theory be maddi break up with nate before the winter formal which be why she be dance with another guy there and cry in the promo fez pul up with a gun at the winter formal and threaten nate and maybe acidentaly shot someone still have not conect the dot as to why rue be in the hospital but I be asume kidney infection or something to do with her bipolar disorder not sure about relapse",
          "lmao his brain be a labyrinth itself I think you hit it on the head his dad be definitely live through he the crepy thumb in mouth spech he give jule nod towards this he say he envys the youth and their oportunity in different crepy word and he tell jule she can either go and live her life outside the town or stay like he and live life in motel room I think he want to be with jule and like she a lot they be together though would destroy the perfection he try to convey to the world he definitely do not care for maddy he just have an obligation in his mind to be withand protect I be excited for the next episode",
          "that be why they can not end it like this but I do see nate getting kill but rue and jule must stay alive with a dark secret and the first season would end on a clifhanger",
          "whether it come from cal or anyone else nate need an aswhope lol",
          "prediction for this finale be fez and nate be go to fight for the gun and in the proces it go off and a bulet hit maddy rue and jule be go to be okay they will talk thing out and then go to the winter formal I be not sure if they will make thing official but I think they will work their way to that eventualy rue be go to be in the hospital due to a kidney infection she will not relapse this finale and honestly I hope she do not at all but I be be to optimistic about it kat be not go to deal with the crepy blank scren dude until next season I agree with everyone that say it be someone we do not know cassie be go to get an abortion cal be go to confront nate about his atitude and perhaps about the mis disc I be super anxious for sunday",

          "what I would add to that be that the scene from the late episode after jule kis she in the pol rue say I just wish she d tell I about last night at this point of the story rue doesn t know that nate be blackmail jule so I would say that her naration of all the character and event be from the perspective of someone who know how the story end xb it s a bit like with memory when we look back on the memory from couple of year or month ago when we already know the consequence of our action it s easy to be wise or look at the event from a different perspective",

          "you all would not be ship nate amp jule together if nate do not have a cute face amp a nice body it be toxic that people be wiling to ignore the red flag because the actor be hot you all know damn well that if nate amp jule end up \" together \" he would treat she like he do with maddy he threaten jule amp abuse maddy even though I do not have sympathy for she for convict an inocent man nate be go behind maddy s back and try to destroy life because he can not handle his sexuality along with control she and abuse her it be a toxic relationship with she push her buton jule be still try to let go of the tyler fantasy and you all take that as an endgame romance be you all mental do ya know what hybristophilia also know as bonie and clyde syndrome and I quote \" hybristophilia be a paraphilia in which sexual arousal facilitation and atainment of orgasm be responsive to and contingent upon be with a partner know to have comit an outrage cheat lie know infidelity or crime such as rape murder or armed robery the term be derive from the grek word hubrizein mean to comit an outrage against someone ultimately derive from hubris hubris and philo mean have a strong afinity preference for in popular culture this phenomenon be also know as bonie and clyde syndrome \" end quote it be like when te bundy be convict and in the court room young woman be clap for he and whop for he I be not say nate be a kiler but the dude have violent tendency I be not say the people on the subredit be a bad people for find nate cute but ya let your lust get in the way and it be kind of concern even if nate realize his bad way and try to be a good person and apologize its to late and also for nate to be with jule and for jule to still want he that be a big no jule be scared of he and be still rel off the tyler fantasy ya take it as a glimer of hope for their \" endgame \" even if nate be a good person and nothing bad happen at all and he be acept his sexuality then yeah be with jule but then I would feel bad for maddy and rue",
          "bro so fucking spot on nate and maddy be so scorpio and arie placement",
          "yo this be an important take I agree that nate have some curvature to his sexuality for the reason you state above and rue explicitly state early in the season \" nate be come to term with his sexuality \" you can tell he genuinely have a fascination with jule from the smiling when they be texte to he sit outside her house watch her to straight up make out with she near the lake and while this portion would not make he gay it could alude to a sort of pansexuality not unlike his father s which get to the important point that for man like cal and nate this be something that must be hide and repres they be strong handsome sucesful white man and they undoubtedly have thing tilt in their favor in life but while a rue have the luxury of fal in love with a girl and make out with she have her slep over often without ever really have to make a big to do about her sexuality these be life ruin secret for a nate or cal type nate so much as have a man s penis on his phone and the whole school gosip about it as some super scandalous thing whereas cal have to create a secret life to kep this from tear the rest of his world to shamble you can hear the pain in his voice as he cry to minako about how he just think he be do what be good for everybody obviously this all stem from the patriarchy toxic masculinity and the ridiculous standard it set for both all gender but this be a salient point as it show that in a case like this those most harshly afect be man which we often forget as in all other domain they be generaly more privileged",
          "all great point but it be a tv show nobody would ship nate with their friend or love one but what s wrong with want a show to turn out a certain way fiction be not always a leson in how thing be suppose to turn out for good people so what be wrong in revel in the drama of rot for the bad guy sometimes yeah he be a gorgeous man and they cast he that way on purpose to show why the woman he abuse might still be interested in he and so the audience doesn t write he off straight away like why do you like he in the first place ew it be fiction and I don t think shame people for be excite about drama in an hbo show of all thing be really fair it be imposible not to notice he s a piece of shit note",
          "I really believe sam be give rue his recovery story get clean at so I don t believe she ll die but the mercutio fez ad tybalt nate paralel sound dope I d like to see it",
          "she could have take nude in the bathrom she doesn t describe the pic she take in there just tell rue she can t talk about they or something like that",
          "after rue take the nude the next scene show jule put her bra back on and rue peaking over so yes they just do not show it on scren",
          "so first off let I start by say the clear vulnerability and fear in nate s dad when he ask jule not to out he be shock and I love that the writer give his character that side it be believable because rue say herself that cal own half the town he could have easily go right to threaten jule nate s dad be show in episode one as extremely intense and this quality be reintegrate throughout the show and even he have some humanity in he his son absolutely none terify anyway onto my nate theory unsurprisingly it seem to I that the writer have make thing dificult for we by give nate the good of both world he be both clearly fuck up with a ton of agresion control issue but he be also very much actually into jule nate watch his dad s tape from a young age which definitely would have impact his sexuality in some way however this be couple with the obvious stigma he knew suround those feeling and his dad s intensity lead he to supres a lot of sexual feeling and have a confused identity this be why I think his feeling for jule be real yes the end goal be sociopath be just to \" play the game \" and it be not out of the realm of posibility for everything nate be do to be some elaborate revenge scheme however I think to much be at stake for he to go to those length texte jule prime her emotionaly manipulate she etc he be clearly a briliant kid and a mastermind manipulator he could have find a different way to prey on she that do not involve so much risk for he he be careful yes but it would take one person see he with jule to have his plan throw back in his face I think he do want revenge for the fact that she slep with his father and maybe he do not expect to fal as hard for she as he do but those feeling be real in my opinion I think his threat of turn she in as a sex ofender be just his safety net no different than how he explain to tyler that it be justify for he to beat he up and that there be nothing tyler could do about it after nate beat tyler he esentialy admit he know it be not rape when he be joke about the entire thing with maddy I think his situation with jule be very similar I be really interested to see how the rest of the season pan out because I personally think it would have be very boring to find out that nate be in love good intentione or that he be straight up out to hurt jule",
