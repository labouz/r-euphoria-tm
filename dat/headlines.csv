7,will Fez forgive Rue for EVERYTHING?,"Hmm so I was wondering peoples thoughts on how you think S3 is going to go in regards to Rue/Fez‚Äôs friendship. Now of course we don‚Äôt know how Laurie is going to play into S3 and we don‚Äôt know if Fez will see anyone if it‚Äôs not behind plexiglass ( I think he‚Äôll be out by mid season but that‚Äôs besides the point, lol) 

We‚Äôve seen Rue start her apology tour in Ep 8 with some of the people that she has hurt over S2, Fez was not one of them. I‚Äôm assuming an attempt to apologize will happen in S3.

Now I can see Fez forgiving Rue for trying to take his grandma‚Äôs meds. I think Fez has a lot of guilt for the part that he‚Äôs played in Rue‚Äôs addiction, so I don‚Äôt think he wouldn‚Äôt not forgive her despite being hurt over the whole situation. 

However‚Ä¶in my opinion, when Fez finds out that Rue went behind his back to do business with Laurie‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs probably going to be friendship over. 

For Rue to have no regards for the consequences, addict or not, for how that decision could have come back on Fez/Ashtray (obviously not Ashtray anymore, ü™¶), I just don‚Äôt see how he‚Äôll get forgive her. 

And there might even be a moment when he realizes that if Rue was never jealous of the relationship between Jules and Nate(as Tyler), and never asked him to intimidate Nate to, then he would have never been raided thus removing the domino effect that has lead to the raid in S2 (him being arrested/his brother‚Äôs death)

I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Lexi would question her friendship with Rue too if she finds out about her involvement with Laurie; we‚Äôve seen how protective she is over Fez when it comes to her sister. Maybe her seeing truly how dangerous Rue‚Äôs decisions are, would make her rethink their friendship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/w2h7cg/will_fez_forgive_rue_for_everything/,w2h7cg,Old_Neighborhood934,58,1658197448.0,0.9,31

9,Hot take on the Cassie v Maddy v Nate situation,"okay so we all know what Cassie did was emotionally unstable, wrong, and betraying to her best friend. BUT... here's a take i don't hear talked about - 

Nate is bad for Maddy and therefore Cassie (being a bestie) should help steer Maddy in a different direction. Cassie having sex with Nate ruins both relationships that Maddy has. She loses her high school best friend, but she also loses her abusive, psychologically insane on&off boyfriend

Sure, Cassie may never be forgiven for her actions - but she might've just saved Maddy from countless harmful encounters with Nate. i wouldn't put it past Nate to kill her if he got drunk and angry. maybe this all worked out for the best in a mentally scaring kinda way? thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/w2kfji/hot_take_on_the_cassie_v_maddy_v_nate_situation/,w2kfji,DIORX8,8,1658207481.0,0.65,11

15,‚ÄúThe thought of maybe being a good person is what keeps me trying to be a good person‚Äù is most likely to be a (if not the) major underlying theme for S3.,"Many of us are aware that Sam appears to have certain underlying themes/concepts that he incorporates into his writing in the show. One of course is that he wanted to explain the reasons characters engage in their respective inappropriate behaviors and leaves it up to the viewer to decide how much empathy, if any, they wish to embrace regarding the character. But at least he wants viewers to have a better understanding of what led the characters to do what they did.

In SE1 I think he expanded upon the underlying themes/concepts he plans on incorporating into the show for the future exemplified by various comments Ali made to Rue.  They included ""forgiveness is the key to change"" and that ""redemption is possible"". **This culminated in the quote noted above by Ali to Rue in SE 1.** So, from my perspective a theme was developing around the concept of trying to become a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù. If you happen to re-watch S2 you will find that the phrase ‚Äúgood person‚Äù (or very similar wording like 'good guy‚Äù) was said in a number of scenes (probably not even registering with most viewers). Interestingly this **concept/idea** of ‚Äúgood person‚Äù was introduced in comments made in separate scenes involving Nate and Cassie, the two ‚Äúbig baddies‚Äù Sam has set up in the show for S3. Just a coincidence? Perhaps, perhaps not. We actually saw in the latter part of S2 some evidence of some characters exhibiting small degrees of mature behaviors including Rue making a decision to at least stop using, Elliot finally being honest with Jules and telling her he was lying about Rue's drug use, Jules telling Rue's mom about her using, Nate apologizing and giving Jules the disc and having his dad arrested, and Maddy deciding to terminate her relationship with Nate. **All of these things then culminated in Rue repeating the same phrase again at the very end of S2.** Again coincidental? I think not. Sam himself even mentioned at the recent LA FYC panel that there was a **shift away** from the ""hedonism, the nihilism, and immaturity"" in the first half of S2 as the last 4 episodes evolved. So perhaps this may also be a clue as to the direction Sam will continue to take in S3.

So based upon all the above I think it is likely that S3 will focus on the teen characters ultimately taking some baby steps towards becoming a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù. None of them are going to become stellar examples of moral righteousness but will at least begin to move in the right direction. They all are going to have baggage of varying degrees that they are going to have to carry with them for the rest of their lives. They are all teens coming from dysfunctional families of one sort or another. They have all been traumatized and emotionally damaged in varying degrees. The tone of S1 and S2 was largely pretty nihilistic in nature. I suspect Sam will continue to shift this tone slowly towards at least a bittersweet type of ending for the main teen characters. I am not suggesting anything even close to a Disney ‚Äúeverything is perfect‚Äù type of fairy tale ending as this is highly unlikely of Sam. The kids are all going to have to continue to struggle in their lives but hopefully will transition towards a new **mind set change** focusing on continuing to take baby steps towards pursuing a goal of trying to become a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù. This, in my perspective, would be the positive endpoint component of a bittersweet ending.  Similarly, I don't think we will see a Marvel type of ending where the ‚Äúgood gals/guys‚Äù triumph over the ‚Äúbad guys/gals‚Äù who are destroyed/eliminated. I just don't think Sam is going to write a story where he is going to have any of the teenagers end up in the latter situation, although probably most all of them will still have emotional wounds/scars from their past inappropriate behaviors which will have an impact on them in the future. But they will have to go on, owning them, but still focus on trying to progress towards trying to become a ""good person"" for the future.

I think it's helpful to keep in mind that this is a **fictional story**. Many of our own real-life expectations of what should or should not happen to many of these characters will be largely ignored or overlooked as **Sam focuses on the themes he wants to present.** For example, it's clear that all the teens need intensive mental health counseling, but this is not likely to be seen happening in the show. Similarly, I don't think we are going to see any significant focus on legal consequences for any of the teens. I suspect many of the storylines that seemed significant in S1 (i.e., jailed Tyler storyline, McKay's assault, maybe Cassie's pregnancy, etc.) will not be followed up on or even mentioned. Viewers are going to be left to make up their own minds about whether they wish to buy into this writing style or not. I suspect some people will not be very happy. Should be very interesting to hear all the responses people will have once S3 is over.  All of the above is just my perspective.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/w17en4/the_thought_of_maybe_being_a_good_person_is_what/,w17en4,DisneyDoc2425,42,1658064436.0,0.93,5

24,s1 Tyler,"I've seen a lot of people feel bad for Tyler because of him getting beat up and going to jail for a crime he didn't commit.

He went to a high school party(mckay just graduated high school he hadn't taken a single college class yet). Then had ""sex"" with the 1st girl to throw herself at him. I did not hear him ask her age to make matters worse. 

I feel like people who feel bad for him either don't know what he did OR don't take statutory rape seriously.

48,"Does Cassie hate Maddy, Rue and Lexi which made her comfortable in betraying them?","I know the reasons behind WHY she did that but I don't understand why Cassie enjoyed torturing and betraying Maddy, Rue and Lexi all because of Nate. It felt like she took pleasure in causing them potential lasting harm, especially ruin Lexi's Play for the evulz? 

I feel like she might fit the Likable Sociopath archetype where she feels empathy and love whenever she deems fit but otherwise doesn't feel anything for anyone and is willing to hurt them to get what she wants and never felt remorse for it.

So I am wondering if Cassie grew bitter and angry and began to hate and resent her sister, Maddy and Rue and saw them as her enemies after dating Nate and wanted revenge against them out of jealousy.

Because that exposed Cassie as a potential antagonist where she will make things difficult for them because she knows their secrets and weaknesses and can easily exploit, manipulate and use it against them like Nate does, which she did against Rue, Maddy and Lexi.

Like it can be a scary thought that what if Cassie will still blame them for her meltdown and do horrific things to them, like try to force Rue to a second relapse because she believes Rue is responsible for her life going downward for exposing her affair.

49,Jacob Elordi Was Snubbed From An Emmy Nomination,"I thought this was obvious until I went onto social media and saw people laughing and celebrating (primarily Zendaya stans) because Jacob wasn‚Äôt nominated for an Emmy. I think Nate Jacobs will go down as one of the more prominent male characters in teen/young adult television and that‚Äôs solely because of Jacob‚Äôs phenomenal acting. 

There‚Äôs never a dull moment with Nate. It‚Äôs to the point where people feel physically ill whenever he appears and we take that for granted. Nate‚Äôs been a significant presence in both seasons and it‚Äôs disappointing to see that Jacob efforts won‚Äôt be celebrated. It‚Äôs easy to overlook his acting when you have actresses like Sydney and Zendaya, where their acting is more in your face. 

It‚Äôs hard to miss Sydney hysterically crying as Cassie or Zendaya whimpering and sobbing as Rue. But sometimes it‚Äôs the little things Jacob does that make him so good. For example, during the play when he leaned back in his seat to make himself ‚Äúfeel small,‚Äù hand across his face while awkwardly looking around to see if anyone was looking at him. 

That was amazing acting. Or the scene with Maddy where he was playing Russian roulette taking slow massive breaths as if a bullet could kill him at any moment despite knowing the gun wasn‚Äôt loaded. It was so believable that people were genuinely terrified watching that scene. Nobody even thought  to themselves ‚Äúthis is fake, it‚Äôs probably empty,‚Äù because they really believe Nate is that crazy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/vy0365/jacob_elordi_was_snubbed_from_an_emmy_nomination/,vy0365,panashechd,491,1657708584.0,0.85,78

Also, in Season 1 Episode 1, we can see Nate making fun of Cassie due to her continuous nudes leakage, as well as making fun of her in the carnival episode to McKay.

75,What was the purpose of this line,"We see Rue spiraling until the point she barely narrates if at all in Ep4 S2. At the end we hear Jules comes in to narrate for the first time as the only other character who has narrated saying, ‚ÄúSince before we ever existed.‚Äù It felt poetic, but I didn‚Äôt really understand the point of Jules saying that. At the time I thought she might narrate the next episode because Rue would no longer be able to and we know where that went. I know a lot of s2 had moments where something felt significant, but didn‚Äôt end up being as deep as it felt like it should‚Äôve been (imo). 

Do we think Jules is going to narrate an episode s3. I doubt it, but I think it would be so cool. Kinda like Jules special episode, but just another episode with her narrating other characters as well as herself. We get to see her in Rue‚Äôs position. What would another pov say about the characters? Maybe she‚Äôd tell things a bit different than Rue. Again I don‚Äôt see it happening. And I know Lexi kinda. had a role of this with her play, but I don‚Äôt see it the same as the real Euphoria narrations by Rue. It was a different style. So Id like to see Jules narrate in the same way. 

What are everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this? Am I missing something and there is a hidden meaning behind her narration? It felt like it was just there as shock factor. Like oh wow Jules is narrating, while at the same time that line didn‚Äôt really lead to anything or have any follow up or explanation so maybe someone can give me one lol.

85,Can we talk screentime s2,"Now i have a few complaints if you will with some of the screen time choices for this season. Nevertheless I enjoy talking about Euphoria no matter what so I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and try to have a little discussion on this because I haven‚Äôt seen an actual post about it. I seen more comments scattered here and there so apologies if there was a post or something like that. 

There are quite a few moments this season that feel a bit unnecessary considering there are only 8 episodes. To add, these scenes, even those that feel very purposeful would quite often feel like the camera lingered a little too long like they doing some filling there.

Not gonna say nothing about the overture lol y‚Äôall already know. 

Funeral. I‚Äôve seen some discussion on this too. If anyone knows the number of times this scene was broadcasted please enlighten me.

Ok, this one is probably the one that bothers me least if at all, but I have to mention it and I will explain why. The montage beginning of episode 4 I think. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: it was stunning, but I couldn‚Äôt help but feel that I‚Äôd rather we get more storyline with all the visuals we already got, it felt like a lot that wasn‚Äôt really made up for by the storytelling. It felt like it was supposed to have meaning that was never really made clear so it ended up feeling meaningless even though it was beautiful to look at. 

If not that, then maybe the end of the episode where we get another montage (i don‚Äôt even know if that qualifies as a montage but wtv). Again, beautiful but how does it actually propel the story or anything in the show really other than breathtaking visuals, which for me, the only breathtaking shot was Cassie‚Äôs and the music really makes that shot fucking explode (in a good way). 


I think so much screentime could‚Äôve been shared with other characters we got less of this season. Things felt very imbalanced in that way of course.

This season just felt like so many scenes were pointless and unnecessary, but those I detailed were obvious. Other times I found myself watching and having moments I felt like..what‚Äôs REALLY the point of this. I would love to hear anyone else‚Äôs opinion and to have a discussion about this.

92,Cassie/Maddy/Nate - the only likeable character is Cassie.,"Okay so I started watching Euphoria after seeing all the posts on insta etc. 

The impression I had of Maddy was that she was a girls‚Äô girl - someone who looked out for her friends and just did some questionable things because of the abuse she was enduring. 

Upon watching it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm seeing? At all. She is manipulative, violent, unpleasant, selfish, lazy??? She‚Äôs horrible to her friends, not a girls‚Äô girl at all.  She is controlling, bad mouths them, and they‚Äôre actually scared of her. Kat blindly agrees with her when she‚Äôs shouting at Nate in the hot tub due to fear (no sympathy for him, but it was bizarre). 

As far as I can see, nothing has happened to her to inspire this unpleasantness towards the people around her.  In her episode, she‚Äôs just described as being born with an acute confidence.  She knows she doesn‚Äôt want to work.  Her dad is a bum.  She‚Äôs entitled and horrible about her own mum, seeing her as one of the little people because she works. 

Nate‚Ä¶ well, he also has daddy issues of course.  He is also terrible. We don‚Äôt need a discourse about why he sucks. 

Cassie is more confusing.  She‚Äôs grown up with an absent parent, whom she idolised, who disappeared overnight and who became an addict.  She can be a bit of a gobby madam to Lexi sometimes, but that‚Äôs literally what most sister relationships are like. 

From the online discourse, I was under the impression that she seemed super fake & she had this ‚Äònice girl‚Äô persona that dissolved behind closed doors.  But you can SEE the anguish of her character.  She way she‚Äôs calling Nate up, texting him all hours, sobbing over the phone, having an existential crisis about being a bad person.  

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong - if I were Maddy, I would be FUMING.  Cassie made a horrible, horrible decision when she slept with Nate.  She has a lot to answer for.  But I can‚Äôt hate her like a lot of the internet does.  You can see in her eyes in the scene where she presents Maddy with a birthday cake & the scrapbook that she is dying inside because of the guilt.  It just‚Ä¶ dissolves when she sees Nate.

I think it would have been interesting if the show had portrayed it as more of a side-by-side with Rue‚Äôs struggle with addiction, we might have gotten more inside the mind of someone with chronically low self esteem.  

The absolute worst part for me was when Rue revealed to the room what was going on between Cassie and Nate‚Ä¶ and Maddy just abandoned the matter at hand to make everything about her, at a VERY inappropriate moment. 

Everyone online is going ‚Äòomg Maddy really cares about Rue ü•∫‚Äô. What???? Where? It doesn‚Äôt take an adult to see that it was a very obvious ploy on Rue‚Äôs part to draw attention away from herself & Maddy just kinda goes with it. 

Cassie‚Äôs actions are inexcusable.  But you can see that she wants to be a good person.  Maddy??? Not so much.  Nate?  Not at all.

Edit:  after being reminded about the whole cheating on McKay thing (which I had forgotten about), I want to revise the last paragraph -

But then his rant back at home!!

gia isn‚Äôt in euphoria because rue doesn‚Äôt know anything about her life, which is why every scene of gia rue is in, but jules was a very prominent character is s1, but in s2 she kinda felt erased, maybe that‚Äôs because rue didn‚Äôt know anything about her cause elliot and her was doing drugs?
 which brings me to why jules cheating isn‚Äôt touched up on nor really explained in  the 4 episodes after, because rue doesn‚Äôt know anything about jules, so she couldn‚Äôt explain why she did it, or maybe it was another one of rues montages where she imagines shit and jules never cheated, and rue thought of that to explain why elliot told jules

117,Maddy and Cassie,"Are Maddy and Cassie actually best friends? because it seems like Maddy likes Kat more.

&#x200B;

Maddy   barely hangs out with Cassie outside of school or invited her to hang out with Her Kat and BB .It always seem like Maddy liked Kat more and that's why she was always with her.I don't know why they are called best friends when they never said they were that close in season 1 and barely even hung out with each other when Kat wasn't there.

&#x200B;

i personally liked Maddy and kat friendship better because i like how Maddy feels like she can come to Kat for her problems

&#x200B;

Cassie and Maddy barely talk to each other for emotional support or advice it always seems like she went to Kat with her issues and never confided in Cassie .If Maddy and cassie are so close how come they dont trust each other enough to confide in one another.Cassie always go to Lexi for advice all the time and Maddy always goes to Kat . 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

what i didn't like about them

Cassie

\- slept with nate and never told maddy

\-always acting like a victim 

\- never apologied to maddy

\- the way she treated Lexi in season 2 (she was nicer to Lexi in season 1)

\-Called rue a drug addict so she wouldn't  have to admit she had sex with Nate

&#x200B;

Cassie daddy issues is not an excuse for what she did to Maddy an she should have apologized to her if she actually felt bad or end things with Nate.I know she had a bad childhood but that doesn't excuse her actions 

&#x200B;

Maddy

\-Selfish

\-materialistic  

\-Manipulative 

\-stayed with Nate  even though she knew Nate was making fun of her so called best friend

\-yelling and threatening  her friends (Kat and Cassie)

\-The Tyler situation 

&#x200B;

Nate didn't make Maddy y the way she is she was already like that since she was little.I seen people say it was Nate's fault Maddy s the way she is.However Maddy is shown to be very selfish and and is shown to be very entitled since was a kid.She also shown to be very arrogant and have anger issues before she dated Nate.

&#x200B;

i really hope Maddy and Cassie get some therapy for their trauma and all the things they went through because no one deserves to be treated liked that.Cassie was slut shamed and had her nudes leaked by all her ex boyfriends and was constantly made fun of. Maddy was a victim of Emotional and physical abuse.She also was a victim of statutory rape since she had sex with a 40 year old man at the age of 14.They also both had parents that fought all the time and both of their parents are alcoholics.They also had neglectful fathers also.I just hope they get some mental help or go to therapy because even though they did bad things they both need help,",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/voooro/maddy_and_cassie/,voooro,LiveExcitement318,8,1656639585.0,0.72,9

Is it homophobia? People who think wlw relationship are boring and ""lack chemistry""? Or people don't like Jules and want to see her ""get what she deserves"" (a misogynistic opinion I've seen quite a bit about Cassie this season). Whatever it is, it's really gross and disturbing.

On one hand I know that Cassie is just projecting and trying to deflect from her problems and taking accountability by shifting the focus onto Rue. She thinks she's not that bad of a person because Rue is a drug addict even though I personally think they are both good people, who just made bad decisions. However, it was wrong and inappropriate....and with that said a very Cassie thing to do. 

On the other hand, I can see where that hurt and anger is. She thinks that their family doesn't have it any better because Rue's dad is gone and there's left. Their father CHOSE to leave them, whereas Rue's father passed from something that was inevitable. 

Losing a parent in general is very traumatic. And I think in the same way that Rue hasn't grieved that loss, Cassie (and Lexi) haven‚Äôt healed from theirs as well.

1x2

* breaks into Tyler's house
* beats the crap out of him
* takes Maddy bowling
* goes home and immediately resumes intense online relationship with Jules

(somewhere within a day or so of this night, he also stalks Tyler to figure out his entire schedule, date of birth, and address)

1x4

* ruins McKay/Cassie's night, plants seeds that will doom their relationship
* plays witness to Jules/Cal drama and low-key lets his dad know he abused a minor
* abuses Maddy, plays victim over the discovered dick pics to get her to forgive him
* meets up with Jules, where he flips from romance to blackmail within 30 seconds

(somewhere within a couple days of this night, he also makes Jules fall in love with him while simultaneously reconciling with Maddy)

2x4

* prepares Maddy's bday present
* gets dogpiled, then puked on in the hot tub
* placates extremely drunk sidepiece
* watches father meltdown while being cited as the biggest regret in the man's life

(somewhere within a couple of weeks of this night, he also almost dies, is hospitalized, starts then tries to end then restarts a relationship with Cassie, while simultaneously almost convincing Maddy to get back together with him)

2x6

* gets in a good workout
* spends day bonding with mom
* finds gun
* plays russian roulette with Maddy
* gives Jules the disc and confesses his love
* moves Cassie in with him

136,Bad scenes / creative choices,"I love Euphoria‚Äôs creative approach and writing and know it is a huge reason the show is so popular and talked about so much, but like any show there are still a number of scenes that i think are genuinely bad and times they tried something new creatively and it just didn‚Äôt work. Some things that i think could have been better:

‚Ä¢Elliots song 
‚Ä¢Rues dance scene in the finale of s1 (Zendaya is an amazing singer and dancer, but it doesnt work for me here, i like how they showcase her dancing abilities in other scenes much better)
‚Ä¢ the behind the scenes thing they did to introduce that Lexi wrote a play
‚Ä¢seeing Rue‚Äôs bladder pulsing when she cant go to the bathroom
‚Ä¢Mckays backstory scene
‚Ä¢Ash being extremely violent in s2
‚Ä¢the scene of jules in the club when she imagines seeing nate and hooks up with anna

Season 3 should focus on Rue being on rehab. We need more funeral scene and flashbacks when she and her dad were still tight. 

I also need a special episode that just focused on Rue on the funeral. Also if we can have another episode on Rue and Ali on a diner for the entire episode and just talking. 

No more Jules, Cassey, Nate, Maddy and Kat. Just Rue.

149,Euphoria is the real and raw high school journey we needed.,"i‚Äôve been watching a lot of youtube videos about euphoria lately, and all i have to say is‚Ä¶I‚Äôm an 18 year old girl. Who grew up in a small town. I know first hand how a small town highschool works. Euphoria depicted EVERYTHING that went on at my school personally. Rue, Kat, Maddy, Cassie, and Lexi are characters i related to. 

Dealing with addiction like Rue, not loving myself like Kat, being in a toxic situation like Maddy, Lost like Cassie, and felt left out like Lexi. 

I don‚Äôt feel like the show is romanticizing drug use. I do drugs and drink alcohol. It shows how we think/feel. Personally when i‚Äôm under the influence i feel at peace. It makes life better, especially after losing my father.

It shows how much we have sex, which is a lot. From age 9-16 i would meet random men online and let them have their way with me. (ITS NOT RIGHT DONT DONIT!). Sex is a coping mechanism, used it to numb the pain or feel alive. 

At my school people rarely carried a backpack. Despite  the dress code, we wore whatever we wanted how we wanted. 

We partied so much, every weekend there was a party to go too. 

We had our own version of Fezco. (I‚Äôm not saying every drug dealer is nice, but some of them are nice and caring. When i wanted to do something stronger, my dealer didn‚Äôt sell to me. He just prayed for me.)

I don‚Äôt feel like the mental illnesses that everyone has is glossed over. It‚Äôs being treated the way a person with mental illness treats it. We know it, but we try our best to live on with it. 

i typed all this to say.. euphoria is in no way promoting drug use, sex, toxic relationships, and ignoring your mental illness. 

It‚Äôs giving you a glimpse into reality. If you‚Äôre impresionable enough to do drugs, get into something toxic, meet strangers online, and have sex.

I say who gives a crap about Nate... his betrayal wouldn't have hurt Maddy more than Cassie's betrayal and so what about cassie's daddy issues and whatever else...How about we all try and excuse Nate's actions to then? It's only fair.... let's excuse the bullcrap Nate does because of his daddy issues because obviously Nate's dad isn't any better than Cassie's dad .....his dad messed him up just as much as cassie's dad messed her up and sure Nate has done so much more messed up things then Cassie but that's not the point 

You can understand why someone does what they did or do but you shouldn't try and defend by using excuses ...what she did was wrong and that's that I honestly don't care about her issues she had a hundred other guys she could've slept because of her daddy issues but she chose Nate knowing everything she knew and yes SHE CHOSE HIM! she took off her underwear all sexy and and stuck her head out of the window trying to be cute she wanted to sleep with him 

I'm also tired of her trying to excuse it by saying they were broken up because that is really dumb...like... gurl you know they are constantly off and on

With all of that being said I understand why she did what she did and I feel for her but....no. I don't excuse what she did in any shape or form. I would've at least respected her more if she owned up to it instead of trying to act innocent and even if she knew Maddy wouldn't forgive her she could've apologized for whatever it would've been worth but tbh she was doing dumb things in season 1 too so oh well",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/vh99do/nate_and_cassie/,vh99do,boltingout,88,1655803601.0,0.78,53

188,Rue saved my life.,"When this show first came out I will be honest I completely ignored it. I thought ""Oh come on another teen drama? Give me a break"". BUT being a fan of Zendaya's after Spider-Man and Dune I figured screw it I will check it out!

One binge watch later and I have to say I am stunned. The acting was great everyone did a great job Story was good kind of meh season 2 but still loved the show but what really hit me was Rue. Not the drugs not the cool girl attitude that Zendaya can only pull off but the mental state it clicked and it clicked hard.

Now see let me take you back if you will to my teens. They sucked. I moved across the state my Freshman year leaving everyone I knew behind and started over with my parents. My dad had a mental break down of his own and tried to kill himself. High School life sucked and something popped into my 14 year old brain. Depression and anxiety. Now at the time  I didn't really think much of it just that I was the ""cool moody kid"" When everyone said I would leave parties or stand in the corner and not socialize but the truth is. I didn't feel like I belonged. I knew something was wrong with me. I felt like a burden.

Flash forward nearly 20 years and I have just turned 34 sitting in my house alone in the dark watching Zendaya act her heart out choking back tears as she lost her mind...then it hit me. ""My god...I need help"". I have NEVER done drugs. Never ""partied"" Never really thought about it but for he last 5-6 months the thought had crossed my mind. I got a bottle of mom's xanax her doctor prescribed her after my dad died in 2019 and honestly I felt like breaking up a few and snorting them. So watching this show I had two realizations. One. Rue is just as fucked mentally as I am and two. Drug's wasn't going to save me. I had to.

The diner talk with Ali was painful. I have watched it at least 10-15 times and I probably will from time to time for the rest of my life. Everything they discuss from her point of view sounded like he might as well have been talking to me. The talk of not planning on being here long. I get that. I have felt that. I use to tell my friends and family I wouldn't hit 20. Then 25. Then 30... It is like I made it but...I didn't really want to be here. Like...its just a long slow drag until the end. But thankfully two amazing shows and one outstanding character played by an actress who just nailed the emotions of it all...I finally started to seek out help.

&#x200B;

( I would of KILLED to have someone like Ali to talk to when I was 17)

&#x200B;

The way she considered herself a burden. The way she talks about her self in a negative way. The anxiety attacks the manic panic walking around The screaming one minute crying the next. That had been me for the last 20 years. Seeing her showed me what I could had been if I had started drugs when I was that age and trust me this mental anguish is not something you can just turn off. There is no magical ""passing"" I kept telling myself as a man If I hit this goal in life and achieved this EVERYTHING would be okay. When the fact of the matter is all I had to do was understand Wow...this is going on in my head. Why is this going on in my head? Finally have that hard talk with friends and family who where TOTALLY supportive and if need be get professional help. This shit even effects your relationships. I have pushed away so many people that really cared for me because I was too busy fighting in my own head. Now I am trying to reach out and reconnect to the ones that will listen. Try to explain to them why I felt like I didn't deserve their love and support. Rue showed me you HAVE TO WANT to be okay. I can talk positive reinforcement all day long but if I didn't want it at my heart at my core it would never happen. The depression the anxiety. EVERYTHING she said in that show rang in my head because I had said it myself a million times before and I just wanted the ""world to be quiet"". That was it. For just any amount of time I could get it. BUT the thing is it wont be. When those thoughts race in your head you have to understand that isn't normal and ask yourself. WHY do you feel that way? WHAT is the root cause? Work it out with yourself and with the ones who care about you. There is something in there that needs to be resolved. If I can work on it you can too.

The ironic part is I felt so numb and dead to the world but since I have saw this show and went on this mental health journey I have cried more in the last 2-3 weeks then I have in 5-10 years.  There are still scenes from this show that chokes me up every time I watch it every time I hear that line because hearing it come from another person is like hearing it in my head almost every day for the last 20 years. But, thankfully now I am not afraid to ask the hard questions it is like ALL that pent up anxiety and depression is just finally being slowly released and flushed out with emotion. All of this because of a show. Because of one amazing character and one awesome actress.

&#x200B;

So if you need to talk to someone. Go talk. Don't wait. Get help. There is no shame in asking for help. You didn't ""give up"". It doesn't make you ""Any less of a man"". You are just finally admitting you need help and there is nothing wrong with it. It took me over 20 years to do it so you can to. PLEASE do it. Just take your time and start having those tough conversations with yourself and then others. Trust me they will listen and offer legit help. If they don't where they really your friends to begin with? I know it can be hard to reach out to a spouse or loved one about this but you will be really happy with the results.

&#x200B;

I really wish there was a way I could reach Zendaya and tell her thank you.

&#x200B;

Also if Rue isn't happy/safe by the end of this show I will fucking die lol

&#x200B;

\-TLDR///// Zendaya's amazing acting as Rue showed me what I was dealing with mentally and kept me from picking up a pill bottle. Having almost all the same horrible mental issues she has gave me the courage to talk to my friends and family and finally ask for help and really helped me reflect internally and start the process of healing and realizing I am not a burden to my friends and family. That I am loved and deserve to be happy. Thanks Zendaya for the awesome acting YOU ROCK! :D

&#x200B;

If you need to check out another show that really hits deep on the anxiety/depression topic I suggest Bojack Horseman. It hits hard as well. Cannot tell you how many times I have watched Both Rue and Bojack and left teary eyed and thinking about my own mental health.

&#x200B;

(Also just know if you need to talk about anything down below just vent or relate Don't be scared to unwind and unload anything you need to get off your shoulders. We are all in this together. Don't let this crazy world make you think other wise. Trust me people do care about you.)

205,Rue and Nate ‚Äì Former friends? Two villains of the story?,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

so I am rewatching the show and I just can't stop thinking about Nate and Rue. It feels sometimes like they both are kind of a villain in the story. They are actually pretty similar in many ways (manipulative liars, who do not hesitate to hurt people around them and even use others to deal with their shit). I genuinely think they are both villains of the story.

Now, there are not many scenes between the two but their relationship is strange. After their prom talk, I keep thinking there might actually have been some kind of relationship between them before (friendship perhaps?). During the prom talk, I just noticed how weird that whole converstaion was. Not only what they say but actually the way they say it and how they behave towards each other. They seem pretty comfortable around each other and they are kinda... polite? They almost seem like, I don't know, respect each other in a way? Nate is very honest with Rue here. And she is like the only person that threatens him he doesn't like get violent with, right? So yeah, I am wondering what the heck their relationship was/is? Anyone gets strange vibes from them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/vbb649/rue_and_nate_former_friends_two_villains_of_the/,vbb649,Red_psychic,26,1655123632.0,0.75,43

209,The Cassie/Nate Paring Was Pointless and Will Likely Go Nowhere,"The entire love triangle between Cassie, Nate, and Maddy was completely out of left field and has few if any ties to season one. We all know this. But Honestly I can‚Äôt get over how baffled I am that they chose to take Cassie and Nate specifically in this direction when there were a plethora of unresolved story arcs they could‚Äôve chosen from season one. Like, how fascinating would a Jules/Nate paring be? Or Cassie facing stigma and even more slut shaming for her abortion? Maybe give Maddy more screen time and a more developed storyline? 

I doubt Nate and Cassie are going anywhere in season three. I‚Äôm pretty sure any relationship they once had is now over. True, Maddie did say ‚Äúthis is just the beginning ‚Äúbut something tells me the writers aren‚Äôt actually going to follow through with this in season three. What else can they really do with that dynamic from a writing perspective? Honestly I fear they‚Äôve written themselves into a corner with this whole subplot. 

I enjoy the Cassie/Nate/Maddie love triangle for the juicy emotional mess that it is, but I don‚Äôt think it was necessary at all, and honestly seems more like something you would hear of as a cut storyline then something that should be in the official show if you ask me.

220,Part of the reason I think why we get upset and say a character is written poorly is because we see ourselves and our own similar bad decisions in them,"One of the strengths of euphoria I would argue is the authenticity of every ~main~ character that while they all have bright moments, ALL of them do bad and stupid crap.

And us young adults (can‚Äôt speak for the old peeps cause I‚Äôm not there yet) aren‚Äôt much better. And it‚Äôs this very fact as to why we‚Äôre emotionally invested in them because we either share similar trauma or poor decisions with them. 

All this to say, I get upset too when I see characters I identify with do bad stuff cause I‚Äôm like yikes been there done that got the t shirt. Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre written poorly usually that means they‚Äôre written very well if they touch a nerve with us.

If you‚Äôve actually read interviews instead of only skimming headlines, you probably know how much Sam collaborates with his actors. Like‚Ä¶ not just talking to them about how to act but also making sure they‚Äôre comfortable with what their character is doing. And reading the articles where the actors talk about his process & character‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt add up with the way the beef sounds. Sure, people aren‚Äôt always how they seem in articles vs. IRL but the actors are talking about what he‚Äôs like to work with IRL. The rumor seems to paint him into a new person.

And no doubt.. Kat was extremely MIA the entire season. But actors sign on projects knowing they‚Äôre going to have to follow the director/writer to lay out the story. If she had a problem with it, she could‚Äôve talked to Sam about it. And she probably did! Since Sam is known for collabing with actors. But the rumors said they had ‚Äúa screaming fight‚Äù and Ferreira ‚Äústormed off set‚Äù??? Although the majority ultimately sided with Ferreira that quite doesn‚Äôt make her look good at all. And tbh, it sounds really unprofessional- which is why I believe Barbie‚Äôs better than that.

Not to mention, Zendaya, producer Jeremy O‚ÄôHarris, Barbie, etc. all disproved it. Against an anonymous tip. 

You could disagree with every point I‚Äôm making by saying ‚ÄúMaybe everything said to disprove it was for PR‚Äù but‚Ä¶ Why are we so ready to believe the worst we hear? And why do we not want to believe that maybe everything‚Äî on this professional set, may I add‚Äî is not awful? Maybe I‚Äôd believe it if it was a director that wasn‚Äôt known for communicating with the actors, but‚Ä¶ ALL the actors have talked about collabing with Sam in a very positive light. Maybe because it‚Äôs interesting to hear this ‚Äútea‚Äù because NGL it was very juicy. 

Please do not attack me. And I‚Äôm not tryna say Sam is perfect‚Äî fuck no, he needs to get his shit together so s3 won‚Äôt be a dumpster fire. thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/v91wsh/i_think_sam_barbies_feud_is_bullshit/,v91wsh,Alive_Engineering_15,141,1654844876.0,0.94,48

Cal is a very flawed character but I don‚Äôt think he is a complete monster. At least cal has shown regret for his actions while Nate has shown none and showed several times he likes hurting people. Cal has cheated on his wife for years but other than that. He is redeemable. He didn‚Äôt know Jules was a minor so the whole he is a pedo argument makes no sense.

229,I had an infection and ended up watching both seasons of Euphoria. Did anyone else.....,"end up buying a whole bunch of glitter like I did? I ended up picking up my medication and buying Kokie Duo Metallic Shadows lol

Anyways, my thoughts: 

The first season was amazing. I enjoyed the second season but I could definitely feel the change in tone. For me the more frustrating parts of the second season was constantly having to watch Cassie cry and the play. Did not like the play. But overall a really good show. 

I feel bad for people who had to wait years for the second season. I watched it all in a hurry and now I'm sad I have to wait for the third. 

Finally I wish I could recommend this to more people, but the show is definitely not for everyone. I can recommend shows about people killing each other but not a show presenting dick picks lol

240,Favorite Aspects of Season 2?,"I know season two gets a lot of hate, but I actually really liked it and I know I‚Äôm not alone lol. Even if you didn‚Äôt like it as a whole, I‚Äôd love to hear what parts if any people did like.

For my favorite aspect, to continue with the unpopular opinions, I really loved Cassie‚Äôs character. While I didn‚Äôt do something as stupid as fuck my best friends ex, I know what it‚Äôs like to be a young girl and feel like a man‚Äôs attention is the most important thing in the world. I think the writing and the performance really tapped into this mindset, especially within the context of Cassie‚Äôs history and past trauma. I know she gets a lot of hate, but I can‚Äôt help but empathize with Cassie because I have that slight relatability with her. 

I also think it‚Äôs cool that the show is exploring this kind of ‚Äúpick me girl‚Äù topic, because I feel like it is done in a way that lays down that what she is doing is wrong, but still provides you with insight into her life to be able to respect and understand the girl.

249,I like Eliot- a diffrent prespective,"Elli really grew on me, ok. 

Yeah, he's an enabler and a bad influence; sometimes, he just kinda sucks, and it's pretty clear that he puts ""having a good time"" above his better judgement.

(or his own safety. Or common sense)

But I think that's what I like about him as a character. He's a personalization of ""fleeting joy/carelessness"".  Intrestingly, that ""carefree"" attitude is both his biggest strength but also his greatest weakness, ESPECIALLY when it comes to personal connections. 

My favorite moment of him is right before that stupid 1000000 years long song. Rue, now after withrawl and with a new amibiton to try rehab again, is visiting him. He asks her if she does drugs. She says no, and then asks: ""you?""

and he simply replies with:

""yeah.""

and there is a bit of helplessness in that exchange, as if we watch above Rue's shoulder and we watch the person she was, that she still might be, that is still in the dark hole she is not quite free from. 

It also served as a remidner that Elliot is an addict still- which people tend to forget because he is a ""funcitoning"" addict. Functioning is in quatation here because he celarly lacks clear judgement and hurts his friends behind their backs. I think there was an attempt to show another expericence of addiction but it fell sort of flat.

It's an absaloute travesty we only saw him interact with Rue and Jules (and his... Roomate/sister?) because it would have been a blast to watch his attitude against Nate's tight laced hyper musculinity, for a example. Or with Kat and her uncertainty of herself and her life. Or against Maddy and her inability to let go and see a future of inner peace. 

The ""plotline"" with Jules is a damn tragedy and (from Elliot prespective) is never explained because WHY would he betray Rue, with whom he clearly has a connection, in that way. It's also never get's resovled within the season and I won't be surprised if it just gets dropped next time. Ugh.  Such a shame, I think showing Jules having a healthy platonic relationship with a guy her age would be a sign of her healing with her understanding of femininity and the place men (don't have) within it, making peace with it. But, sure, lets go with cheating plotline. 

So, what are your opinions? Do you like/hate Elliot? Why? And do you want to see more of him in the enxt season?",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/v75nsq/i_like_eliot_a_diffrent_prespective/,v75nsq,disco_nnected,21,1654630973.0,0.87,13

258,Unpopular Opinion: Lexi was right,"I think this is going to get me yelled at in here bc it is the one thing everyone seems to universally agree on: That the carousel scene Lexi included in the play was unnecessarily mean.

But I think that it was an age appropriate (for someone of Lexi's writing experience) to attempt to show vs. tell (which is a pillar of writing!).

The thing that makes everyone say that the carousel scene in the play was a bridge too far is that we are taking the event at face value, vs. what it shows us and teaches us abt Cassie. The carousel scene humanizes Cassie in a favorable way like no other event Cassie takes a part of. Here she is, vulnerable and hurt, trying to escape, being a teenager on drugs and suddenly, she has this incredibly private experience made public by her own hand! She was just trying to feel good and got carried away! Even from a moral stand point Cassie is a victim there. I mention morality bc an argument can be made in the majority of Cassie's dumb teenage choices that she is in the wrong: Cheating on her boyfriend by kissing some dude (even though, understandable! He was a dick to her!), having sex w her best friends boyfriend, etc etc

But Lexi including that scene, in the context of everything else in the play was an attempt to humanize her. That this would go over the heads of a bunch of teenagers? Sure! And it did! It spectacularly backfired. But it seems in line w a novice writer who feels the idea is *brilliant* at the time, and who feels like they might be able to pull it off w enough sophistication to help people see more than a surface event. It fits thematically w the rest of the play (showing vulnerable and complex and bad sides to everyone!), and is pretty on brand for a young writer.

Idk I might also be injecting some personal experience there bc when I look at old writing (particularly writing from my teenage years), I sure af thought I was doing something and now I can see that I was nowhere near doing the thing.

270,In regards to Jules in season 2,"Ignoring the fact i feel most should watch the special episodes for Rue and Jules before the season to even judge their characters there. I feel people overlook that Jules really doesn't have many closer friends besides Rue she basically just has Kat and the old friend from before she moved. And she states in the special episode how Rue was the first person from her pov who felt like they treated her for her. We don't get too much about the Elliot/Jules stuff moreso whether Elliot actually loved her or was just playing with her but during that time Rue relapsed and Jules didn't know so took her indifference towards her as Rue not caring anymore so the thing with Elliot was how he basically seemed to not care about the layers and facade Jules puts on and sees the real her beneath so basically impulsively did what she did it's not in my opinion proper love but really just a sign of how desperate for real love and care from others because she doesn't really feel she gets that from anyone. 

I'm just hoping season 3 has her heal more and find out who she is for herself without relying on anyone else for validation.

Im just wondering if she noticed the difference in how he acted with her versus Maddie or if she just didnt care.

287,I don't think Rue will ever fully recover.,"In order for anyone to ever recover from something to the degree in which Rue is going through, they need a VERY strong support system to help guide them through possibly the worst part of their life, and Rue does not have that. She lost all trust she had with her mom after her interrogation and flushing her stash down the toilet she got from the mega-dealer. Jules has shown time and time again that she is more than willing to just leave Rue when things get hard, and after witnessing Rue meltdown after telling her mom, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd want to be around when Rue ACTUALLY goes through withdrawals. Elliot definitely doesn‚Äôt want to help her as he is just as bad, if not worse, than Rue is, and his relationship with Jules could be compromised if he were to help her. Fez is literally her drug dealer and would probably be her best bet but he, also, has shown time and time again that he isn‚Äôt really trying to help her but more or less just protecting her and letting her do (and take) what she wants. After the situation with Ash in the last episodes of season 2, I highly doubt that Rue is anywhere close to his top worries, if he‚Äôs not in prison in season 3. All Rue has is her NA friends, but she has to actually go to the meetings to talk to them and she hasn‚Äôt been the most reliable to show up. If Rue can‚Äôt even help herself and show that she actually wants to get and stay clean, no one is going to want to help.

There really hasn‚Äôt been any information in the show regarding the characters going to school and how well they do but it‚Äôs safe to say that Rue isn‚Äôt doing the best with her recreational activities after school. After school is over, if she doesn‚Äôt flunk out first, I really don‚Äôt see Rue going to college or getting a job, leaving her with absolutely no structure in her life. Whether or not she actually paid attention in class, school gave her something to do during the day. When that gets taken away, she‚Äôs going to have more free time than she could ever imagine, and it's pretty obvious what she's going to do with that time, drugs. The free time-no support combo is something that's going to keep her in the same situation for some time to come.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/v474rn/i_dont_think_rue_will_ever_fully_recover/,v474rn,Klewlis12,8,1654284962.0,0.7,1

Then Mouse wants like, fucking hundreds of dollars for literally the cheapest opioids on the market at the moment? The amount he gave her wasn't even worth $50. I have no clue what is going on. That interaction made zero sense. 

Also, how is Rue ever paying for anything? She's the most unmotivated drug user I've ever seen in my life. Her scoring drugs involves...begging for them? Not figuring out ways to get money, and then use said money to get drugs? For someone that seems to really rely on them, she seems to get by on the kindness of freebies - which would never be so frequent nor last long enough that you'd become an addict to that degree.

291,In defense of Elliot (as a character),"I see alot of fans hated or wonder why Elliot was there or even needed. I agree to certain extent but I think he served a purpose. I think Elliot was useful with him being a bad influence on rue that she wants to do drugs with that won't always question her and sobriety. 

I heard another reason that Elliot was used to expose the depth of Jules and rue incompatibility but I personally think they could have explored this without Elliot. I feel Anna with the first season accomplished that. 

He served a small purpose but a purpose nonetheless. I don't have a problem with this because the show and actors were honest about Elliot being a plot device . There was an interview with Zendaya , Hunter and Dominic , and Zendaya said she initially didn't see the purpose of Elliott's character until Sam convinced her about his purpose in the story of tearing Jules and rule apart. That was his purpose. I think he was useless in that regard but he still served a purpose in showing rue having a metaphorical devil on her shoulder. 

If Elliot received an episode, fans would complain about him receiving an episode similar to how fans complained about Mckay an episode in season 1 when they both a very little effect  on the overall plot or Story. Eliot was used as a side character and presented as a side character so he did his job as opposed to McKay's character who is presented as a main character but didn't function as a main character through promos, he was marketed as one of these seven main characters but we all know that was not the case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/v3gvgh/in_defense_of_elliot_as_a_character/,v3gvgh,Truss1996,22,1654198378.0,0.74,24

310,Cal has a lot of potential as a character,"The way Cal exited season 2 left A LOT of room for him to come back. I actually ‚Äúliked‚Äù his character, not so much as a person because he certainly was not a good one, but because he gave a lot of depth, and entertainment, to the show.¬†

His development as a character was very interesting, especially with the flashbacks to his teenage years leading up to him leaving, and his even his past actions in the show; from his introduction with Jules, to them at the carnival, to the tape being passed around, to his highschool flashbacks, to the way he finally left. Cal definitely wasn't a main character but he certainly had the plotlines to make me wish he was.

In season 3, I think Cal needs at least an episode of explanation, if not a full return. I know he has a lot more to say, and maybe even do (with his ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù business with him getting in between Nate and Fez). An explanation of his later years after high school, to him meeting his wife, and even getting more into how he and his wife raised Nate, which would maybe even give some insight to why he is the way he is.

313,The Absolute Worst Intervention Ever Staged,"I see people talking about whether Jules was ‚Äúin the right‚Äù by telling Rue‚Äôs mom about Rue‚Äôs relapse, or talking about if Rue overly freaked out, or if mom is approaching the problem correctly, but I really haven‚Äôt heard anybody talk about how TERRIBLY Rue‚Äôs intervention was staged.

Rue‚Äôs mom threw away an overtly and conspicuously enormous cache of drugs. (Like seriously, I understand wanting to get them out of the house, but I really do believe the slightest amount of thought could‚Äôve told her that her tossing it would endanger Rue, but whatever this is not what this is about lol.) She obviously knew Rue would not react well to this. She knew she‚Äôd blow up cause Rue‚Äôs not afraid of being violent/aggressive to her mom and sister. 

Then Rue finds Jules and Elliot in the living room. This not only informs her WHO told her mom, but it communicates to Rue that they‚Äôre conspiring together, and with her mom too. Her mom knew Rue would blow up, then had Jules and Elliot secretly in the next room in a blatant attempt to embarrass Rue and punish her for acting the way she knew she would. Excuse me? In what world is this a good idea? Are they trying to shame her into submission? It falls through, with Rue doubling down on her hatred for everyone involved.

Obviously an intervention was needed, but to begin it with 1) directly confronting Rue about her lying and 2) throwing away her (LITERALLY MASSIVE) suitcase away, then pulling a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù on her when she freaks out (with help from her girlfriend and the guy she‚Äôs cheating on her with) was such an awful execution of an intervention, and only eroded Rue‚Äôs trust in the few people she loved.

315,what should have Rues mom done?,"So I've been thinking about this a lot because I feel like the real life implications of a mother throwing away 10 000$ worth of her daughter's drugs was totally glossed over in the show. In real life, Laurie would have fulfilled her promise to have rue kidnapped and trafficked. As a recovering addict, I've often heard of ppl chucking their friends drugs and essentially putting them in debt with their dealers. These are usually dangerous people, and although I'm pretty confident rue wound not have been able to pay Laurie back either way (she was using from her own stash right) I don't think her mom did the right thing either. 

If the show had brought up Rue's race as part of the dilemma, I'd be more inclined to forgive her mom. It wouldn't be good for a black girl to be caught w enough drugs to be charged w intents to sell. If her mom had used that justification, perhaps it would have been believable. But the whole police chase, not a word was said about race or police brutality. 

So what should she have done? Hid the drugs? Locked them away? I'm genuinely asking because I'm not sure there's a right answer. Throwing away the drugs did very little but make rue panic and run away to Laurie (who would not have let her leave if this weren't a show). I don't think she was wrong about confronting her, but throwing away that many drugs was a bit over kill. Didn't you see the size of that suitcase? Rues mom must have realized she was in over her head. I think that's when she should have told her the whole Im-gonna-focus-on-gia-now spiel. The show made a point of saying that the reverse psychology worked on rue, so maybe her mom should have lead with that? That she can't keep forcing rue to get clean, and that if she wants to die she can go ahead with it, but not under her roof and not in front of Gia. Would rue have left w the drugs and continued down an even darker path? Or do you think that might have helped rue snap out of it? 

I'm a recovering addict as well, I didn't use opiates so I understand that there's a lot I can't understand. When my psychologist confronted me about my use, I went on a binge that allowed me to see my problem and face it (although I'm far from being recovered). I know it takes a lot more for some addicts to decide to get clean. I'd like to work w more extreme cases of addiction one day, and I was wondering if any of you have ever had experiences with addicts like rue? Did anything end up getting through to them and what was it? 

In the case you've lost a loved one to addiction, I'm really sorry to bring up those memories. Addiction is a disease that is degenerative and fatal. By sharing our stories, there's a chance we'll help someone else pull through to the ""other side"".  Addiction changes who you are, and if you ever need to talk to someone about any addiction (habit addictions are just as bad and they are valid) my DMs are always open.

Edit: if there's one thing I wanted ppl to gather from this post, it's if any of you guys ever find a loved one's stash, for the love of God do not just chuck it. But a lot of ppl seem to think that's an ok thing to do. So let me explain. It essentially stems from the idea that the greatest danger addicts face is themselves (partially true), but in real life (and I can't stress this enough) rue would be either dead, or gone without a trace. Drugs were NOT the biggest danger Rue was facing. I understand that Rues mom did not know that. Which is why I'm making this post, so that you ppl do know. If you find a loved one's stash, confront them about it, do what you have to do, but chucking it can put them at risk of actual death ( either from withdrawal or debt collectors). Either way, you won't be achieving much by throwing the drugs away. If they wanna use, they'll get more, even when they're already in trouble.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/v0fhto/what_should_have_rues_mom_done/,v0fhto,Just_Ad3943,137,1653843740.0,0.92,55

318,I want Lexi and Cassie to heal,"This shouldn‚Äôt be a competition between which sister has the most trauma. But they are both disconnected from each other because of it. I understand siblings fight but idk, between Cassie‚Äôs personal insults and Lexi using the play to vent, it seems like a lot of projection being tossed at each other. 

Lexi projects her feelings of being in everyone‚Äôs shadow onto Cassie by thinking of her and portraying her like a vain slut. And Cassie projects her emotional turmoil with Nate by hurling personal insults, such as calling her a ‚Äúfucking loser with no self esteem‚Äù. Boy Cassie, are you sure you‚Äôre not talking about yourself?

I think if the Howard family had family therapy, they‚Äôd benefit from it and start treating each other better. Honestly, I think Cassie would become more strong and probably leave Nate.

325,meaning behind 'right down the line' being used twice?,"do y'all have any theories on why right down the line by gerry rafferty was used twice in season 2 (episodes one and two) and what it could mean? it could just be a coincidence, but i'm pretty sure everything is done intentionally.

perhaps i'm reaching, but i was just thinking about how maybe it symbolizes how rue deals with her issues and / or trauma? if i remember correctly, the first time we hear it, rue, fez, ashtray & faye are being held at gunpoint in laurie's apartment. while it ends up being resolved in the end, i can imagine this being quite scary and traumatic to most people, especially considering the fact rue and faye were meant to stay in the car. then, in the second episode, rue and elliot hang out and do drugs together, and the song is playing again. 

could this symbolize how rue deals with a lot of things by doing drugs? the lyrics seem very fitting as well. or did she just discover a song she really likes? i have no idea whether i'm reaching or if it's painfully obvious lol. what do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uzll32/meaning_behind_right_down_the_line_being_used/,uzll32,sometiime,12,1653738155.0,0.83,7

328,McKay‚Äôs situation,"McKay is gone after the first episode of season two, it sounds like a waste of a character that could‚Äôve been great, if he was better written. But, at least for me, it looks like Sam was in a corner because of the way he established McKay‚Äôs character. 

Sam has a hard time writing about things he‚Äôs not familiar with (I‚Äôm not saying his writing is trash or that he‚Äôs not capable of writing something out of his ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù zone. His writing truly shines when it‚Äôs about things he has experience with, like Rue‚Äôs addiction, and I don‚Äôt see the same level of quality/consistency when it‚Äôs not case. Sometimes it‚Äôs more of a hit, sometimes it‚Äôs more of a miss), and I‚Äôve seen multiple people criticizing Sam for how he failed to properly write a black man navigating through the academic world and a victim of sexual assault, because it looked like he had no idea about what he was doing. 

Another problem is how McKay ended up isolated from the rest of the characters. He‚Äôs in college, so he‚Äôs in a completely different environment. McKay‚Äôs connections can be resumed to Nate, Cassie and the twins, none of them are in McKay‚Äôs college. So there are two [most obvious] options: 

1. Flash McKay‚Äôs environment out, which means adding more characters to the story, since he can‚Äôt only interact with nameless characters. But Euphoria already has a lot of characters and, as we‚Äôve seen on season two, the show is struggling to focus on all of the main cast. 

2. Remove McKay from college and bring him to everyone else‚Äôs environment. This would require some screen time to be properly done since his arc on season one was centered in the university. Sam already doesn‚Äôt seem to know how to write the character, he‚Äôs already struggling to give an arc to everyone, and McKay is not a fan favorite. Doesn‚Äôt seem way easier to just write him out?

If nothing changes, then McKay relies on special occasions, like holidays or events, and phone calls to interact with the rest of the characters.

McKay deserved so much better, he ended up with no resolution and he was supposed to be as important as the rest of the main cast. Like, he had a ‚ÄúMcKay episode‚Äù, just like Rue, Maddy and everyone else. He could‚Äôve been to Nate what Maddy was to Cassie in the whole ‚ÄúCassie x Nate‚Äù situation. But it would require at least some work",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uykr8o/mckays_situation/,uykr8o,a_veryclevername,157,1653608435.0,0.94,79

331,I think it's messed up Lexi's pursuing Rues drug dealer and enabler,"If anyone saw the ravages of drug abuse in Rue it was Lexi. Doesn't she know that Fez was giving Rue drugs? The fact that he stopped giving her drugs at some point doesn't mean shit, btw, because she's already hooked (or idk the narrative in season two was messy- she just like quits apparently for the whole school year, nothing having actually changed in her life, its implied she goes to school on Suboxone which is super weird, and they totally gloss over the whole mental illness part of sobriety (in the second season)). 

You remember the way Laurie just kinda let's Rue leave? My guess is that after having given her the morphine intravenously she's not worried about rue leaving because she knows shes gonna come back, somehow, eventually, for more morphine. Obviously that's not how real life drug dealers operate, but it proves the point that there aren't any morally superior drug dealers, whether they're your friend or not. You don't know who's an addict and who's not, who's got the gene and who doesn't. For some, that first high is the end of everything. And Rue is one of them. So how would Lexi justify this to herself? He's hot?? I agree that Rue would have ended up using whether fez provided them or not, but Fez is providing her. And drug dealing is the perfect business : selling a perfect product takes no effort, it sells itself. In the end, for a long time, fez would profit from his friends addiction. 

Literally just wanted to write this out from the perspective of an addict who also thought that my friend/drug dealer wasn't that bad. But they were. And people are really giving Lexi some kind of moral high ground when, in my opinion, if anything had happened between Lexi and fez, I'd see that as a deeper betrayal than Cassie sleeping w Maddy's ex. And the show doesn't even recognise any of this as problematic. I really hope there comes a moment in season 3 where rue burns bridges with people for her sobriety. Not only would that be an interesting new dynamic, but it would also be more representative of what they teach you in NA

Edit: this got a lot of traction, I just wanted to say that I don't think that if you're a felon or if you've committed crimes that you're necessarily bad, that's not what I meant to say and I'm sorry if it came off that way. I understand class struggle and poverty which leads to crime. I wanted to highlight the drug dealer + addict friendship dynamic because I feel thats when things can get really messy and the show kinda glosses over that.

Since this post is still getting more attention, I wanted to summarize what I meant: in real life, it is RARE that your drug dealer friend actually has your best interest in mind. The show is kinda saying ""you can be an addict who is friends w a drug dealer and it can still be an all round healthy and beneficial friendship"" which is not accurate all the time with real life addicts who probably would not be able to dissociate the drugs from the friend. In season one Rue even relies on him to ""spot"" her when she has no money, and that makes me think of the whole time they were friends off screen before season 1, when she'd buy drugs more and more from him over time. Did alarm bells not start ringing then and there? Its not like she bought weed from him once and then on she was an addict: there was a gradual build up. I think if he were really her friend, he would have stopped her on the day he said that ""drugs weren't the solution"" like literally in season 1 episode 1.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uy87z3/i_think_its_messed_up_lexis_pursuing_rues_drug/,uy87z3,Just_Ad3943,263,1653573457.0,0.7,132

335,After S2 I'm not interested anymore..,"S2 was OK to watch, but TO ME it lost the specialness. This season lacked so much of Labrinths scores and in generell his music, I know it was supposed to be more serious as it should seem like after the party is over but it just didn't work for me. The lighting was not it. I didn't like it at all. I know some liked it but it's just me. To me the lighting/the color was something that belonged to Euphorias identity, Labrinths music and I'm sorry but I liked how they filmed the first season way better. I did not like that it was on ""film"" and that it was hyped up so much didn't do nothing for me. The S2 plot was not really satisfying and felt all over the place it still feels unnatural to me what happened between Nate and Cassie ( even tho in real life stuff like that happens all the time and is realistic). In my opinion they've rushed their relationship and slapped it in our faces without showing any depth to their relationship , just sex, one fight and one breakup. Their was done as fast and sudden as it came. They should've at least let them start to hang out together then feel attracted to each other and let it slowly progress to first a very beautiful relationship until they show us how Nate starts to play mindgames with her,manipulates and belittles her. But in stead it was rushed. Also the reveal felt so underwhelming, I mean when Rue exposed Cassie for sleeping with Nate. I was so dissatisfied and disappointed . While in S2 I see traces of Cassie from S1 ,she still feels way to far away from her character in S1. I don't know why it feels like that but it does. The whole season felt all over the place and very unstructured. I didn't like what they did with Jules either and I can't stand it that she always says I love you and then proceeds to kiss other people. I know in S1 they weren't officiall BUT let me tell you SHE DID LED RUE ON. Then in S2 when they're finally dating she didn't even blink an eye to cheat on Rue. While I like Jules as a person herself, I don't like how she acts in a relationship or how she leads on her love interest and then kisses other people. I like her but not in a relationship, not with Rue and in fact I think neither Jule nor Rue need a relationship right now. They need therapy and good people around them and unfortunately even tho Jule and Rue are quite alright as individuals they are TOXIC for each other and that's for sure. Also while I enjoyed Fezco referring to Jules as Jule and I find it funny, it bugged me that in S1 when he was ""threatening"" Nate he knew her name and called her Jules and then in season 2 he all of the sudden forgets the ""S"" behind it ? Forgets her real name? The whole season was very underwhelming and really not worthy all those years of waiting. I mean..it was what 2 years ? I wished he didn't play with the original script so much because we might've gotten something really good then. But yeah all in all after S2 I lost interest and I am not hyped for S3 nor am I waiting for it as I was waiting desperately for S2 (only to be disappointed) In S1 storylines were build up, only for them to be nearly non existent in S2. I have no expectations for S3 and if it releases one day I will only watch it once I stumble upon it just to see what they did with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uy2if8/after_s2_im_not_interested_anymore/,uy2if8,Possible_Fix988,12,1653551914.0,0.56,75

351,Has anyone else here noticed this about Cassie‚Äôs reaction to Lexi‚Äôs play?,"So I‚Äôve been rewatching S2E7 and I noticed that throughout the first parts of Lexi‚Äôs play, Cassie seems not to care. Even during the scenes that are directly about her and making fun of her, she doesn‚Äôt really react. This includes the scene where Lexi talks about Cassie going through puberty, the comment that her mom makes about her body, etc. None of it phases her at all‚Äìuntil the scene about her and Maddy.

The scene where Maddy is crying in Cassie‚Äôs bed about her parents having a shitty marriage and Cassie comforts her is the first scene that Cassie seems to have some sort of reaction to. In her seat, her eyes blink rapidly a few times and we see her leave her seat, which is then followed by her infamous bathroom breakdown where she tries to pull herself together and smile to prove that she‚Äôs happy. She puts up a mask, an illusion so to speak, and goes back out to her seat and her life with Nate. She pretends that nothing is wrong.

Then when Nate‚Äôs scene happens and he gets indirectly outed, the illusion shatters. It‚Äôs the next time she has any sort of reaction to Lexi‚Äôs play, when she repeatedly looks at Nate in shock/horror/embarrassment during the musical number and after everyone starts applauding and giving a standing ovation to the scene. Then this is followed by the scene where she follows Nate out of the auditorium and he breaks up with her, which leads to her going into a rage and disrupting the play, etc.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the first to point these specific details out since there are millions of Euphoria fans out there, but I think it‚Äôs a really good detail that aside from the carousel scene in the finale, the only two parts of Lexi‚Äôs play that get a reaction out of Cassie are the ones that remind her of two important things that she ultimately chose to ignore when pursuing Nate: the first being that Maddy was a real friend to her and someone that she had comforted through the darkest times in her life, and the second being the ambiguity surrounding Nate questioning his sexuality (which, ironically, was told to Lexi BY Cassie in S1).

The detail with her only truly snapping once Nate breaks up with her is something that gives true insight into Cassie‚Äôs character, IMO. She had no problem with being body shamed or otherwise made fun of until the play caused her to lose the male validation that she essentially threw her home life away over. She only cares about Lexi ‚Äúhumiliating and embarrassing‚Äù her with the play when she has to be reminded that she was a bad friend and that she ruined her relationship with her family and friends for a guy who not only mistreated her best friend, but might not even be straight at all. And this is not to say that Lexi didn‚Äôt too far with her play (especially with the carousel scene), because she absolutely did and it would be discussed, but people talk about her going too far with the stuff regarding Cassie going through puberty when, in reality, Cassie didn‚Äôt give a damn about that being in the play. When Cassie is saying that Lexi is humiliating and embarrassing her, she most likely meant the scenes that I mentioned above.

I‚Äôm curious to hear other people‚Äôs thoughts on this, though. What does everyone think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uvsu0w/has_anyone_else_here_noticed_this_about_cassies/,uvsu0w,goatropes,247,1653282718.0,0.98,61

354,Lexi Deserves Empathy Too,"So I've noticed that people in this fandom have so much empathy for Cassie and none for Lexi. Cassie got with the guy who abused her best friend and spent the entire season having sympathy for no one but herself, but she constantly has people bring up her trauma, rationalize her actions, and hope she is forgiven. That's fine, but I think it's hypocritical how people look at Cassie as some poor, traumatized teen girl who isn't in control of her actions, needs to be coddled, and is worthy of forgiveness, but don't award an ounce of that understanding to Lexi; Lexi is just some jealous, evil pick me that wants to see her pretty sister suffer.

People are always talking about how you need to read between the lines with Cassie and bring up her trauma, but it's acceptable to have the shallowest takes about Lexi. Lexi has been through stuff too, but she isn't seen as a traumatized teenage girl with her own problems in this fandom. She is only seen as someone who should be providing emotional support to Cassie. But I'm sorry if Cassie had a shitty upbringing, so did Lexi. Lexi really has no one: dad abandoned her for drugs; best friend abandoned her for drugs; mom admits to being neglectful; older sister is unreliable and chooses men over her. 

Why does Cassie get the excuse of being a teenager, but Lexi (who is younger) is expected to be super mature and have all this understanding and support for someone who isn't there for her? People never view anything from her point of view. From the time they were kids, Lexi could see the danger of their father in a way that Cassie couldn't; it was Cassie who convinced Lexi to get into the car with their high father, something that traumatized Lexi; it was also Lexi who comforted Cassie at the hospital after he was in an accident. But Cassie feels like she was the only one that was hurt by their dad leaving, and imo she resents Lexi a bit because she doesn't think Lexi cares about their dad.

People have also got to stop acting like Cassie isn't mentally draining to deal with. Lexi had to deal with Cassie screaming the house down, insulting the people she cared about, lashing out at her, hiding knives because Cassie is an attention seeker. Cassie then also straight up left the Howard household to go be with Nate. Lexi is by no means perfect and I empathize with Cassie struggling, but it's not fair to expect so much from Lexi when Cassie gives nothing in return.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uvelna/lexi_deserves_empathy_too/,uvelna,The_Proponent,399,1653237348.0,0.89,87

360,An alternate perspective on Cassie's betrayal,"(Brief warning that I do have a lot of sympathy for Cassie so pls don't dogpile if y'all think this is harsh)

Something that's always baffled me is how people fail to realize the true extent of what Cassie did. She didn't *just* sleep with her bestfriend's ex... She slept with her bestfriend's abuser. Plain and simple there's no way that between all the shit below people (I.E. Cassie - Maddy's bestfriend at the time) didn't connect the dots (Evidence taken from S1E5)

 -Everyone at the school learning of the dickpicks on Nate's phone
-Him getting pulled out of school by officers/questioned then suspended briefly 
-The football team getting told about the ""zero tolerance policy"" 
- AND the students having to watch a Domestic Violence education video (WHERE MANY STUDENTS POINTEDLY LOOK AT MADDY)

Even during the bathroom confrontation after Maddy finds out, she says ""I'm sick of it. He put me through hell and now he took my fucking best friend""
Maddy has her own flaws/bad actions but this kind of betrayal from Cassie is a new low. It's more than just some teen drama of ""omg she slept with her ex"" It's a best friend knowingly choosing someone's abuser over them. Obviously Cassie's own mental problems and Nate's manipulation/abuse play a big part into it- but there's no denying that (imo) this kind of betrayal is nearly unforgivable

363,Did Cassie get treated slightly unfairly?,"I get it. She slept with her best friend's ex. There was no justification for that. However, I felt much of her depiction was slightly offensive. 

Lexi saw her as another girl from high school and couldn't get passed the fact that she got attention due to her body. Her mom saw her through those lens. Nobody in her family tried to protect her or tried to sit down and talk to her about her actions like most family members do regardless how much wrong another person supposedly did. Her mom viewed her as a homewrecker and her sister just always have and always will view her as a sex object/temptation. They didn't care when she moved out with Nate. Her friends didn't care for her either as they all took Maddy's side and nobody even asked her or looked out for her to find out why she had done what she had done and some even cheered Maddy on when she was trying to beat her up. 

I mean other than her dad abandoning her, her nudes were leaked, she had gotten an abortion and Lexi saw her as nothing more than the sister that steals her attention and for what, a bigger pair of tits and blonde hair. They're both beautiful. But this aspect of this show, I found pretty annoying. That was in stark contrast to how Rue's relationship with her sister was depicted. Both these sisters were shown to care for another. And also, need I say, that Cassie's mom was pretty encouraging of Lexi and her play. I just don't get why anyone would humiliate their own member of their family like that. Your family is your honor. But people like Nate is depicted as trying to protect his father despite his flaws and people like Lexi wants to humiliate her own sister, throw her under the bus for entertainment. 

Anyway, the whole thing just made me feel like everyone saw her through nothing more than her sexual value. Also, Maddie didn't have boobs and she was declared one of the hottest girls in school. So if Lexi wanted all that attention, all she had to do was dress a little differently.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uuvbj7/did_cassie_get_treated_slightly_unfairly/,uuvbj7,DefiantNinja942,39,1653164972.0,0.73,24

373,Confusion on how they depicted the LGBTQ community and how 'accurate' the representation was,"I have a lot of questions about Nate, Kal, and Juel. Firstly, I want to say that I respect and support the LGBTQ community and I will try and be cautious with the way I word my questions. I ask these questions out of curiosity.  I want to know whether these characters were an accurate representation of the LGBTQ community or whether these characters were even a better representation because of their depth, and ambiguity that goes beyond just stereotypes of this community but represents the fluidity in sexuality and gender expression. 

I'll start off with Kal. It was assumed he was gay or at least bisexual but why did he enjoy having sex with transsexual women if he is gay? How does he even enjoy sex with his wife if he is gay? Also, is it assumed he went to jail for pedophilia ? Did he have sex with underaged boys/transwomen?

Also, are people that under go a sex change operation transitioning from male to female, is it normal for them to also be sexually attracted to the gender that they transitioned into or is that very rare that a seemingly straight former man/trans women could like and be attracted to other women or be bisexual?

As for Nate, if Nate does question his sexuality and might not be entirely heterosexual, then was his feelings for either maddie or cassie ever real or just some power play. There's also this theory going around that Nate liked cassie because she has a resemblance to Jules. There was this one time when he imagined his dad kissing cassie's back or something and I believe she represented Jules. It begs the question how much of his actions and thoughts are run by this subconscious fear of being consumed or ruined by his father. He falls for a girl his father banged who he cannot be with. It's almost like he fears his father's shadow. 

Anyway, I understand that gender expression and sexuality isn't always binary but the amount of fluidity shown in this show and the apparent deviation from heteronormative behaviour and also homosexual behaviour (or at least the representation we're used to), do you guys feel like it is an accurate representation or normal even ?

I mean, given these characters' actions, we would have to believe that all of these characters are bisexual or pansexual. I'm just trying to figure out how common these forms of expressions are because some of the characters even for the LGBTQ community seem to be very rare or go outside of behavior that I would typically expect. 

Anyway, I may sound ignorent and I have no intention to hurt or offend anyone. I just want to be more informed and was curious about the topic so I made this post. If anyone wants to give me an explanation especially one from the LGBTQ community, I'd be greatful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uv3ktj/confusion_on_how_they_depicted_the_lgbtq/,uv3ktj,Jaderosez,0,1653194043.0,0.32,10

383,A deep dive into Nate's relationship to Jules and his dad.,"After finishing season two, I think Sam Levinson is going in the direction that Nate is jealous of Jules and has mixed feelings about his dad (specifically, on the topic of the nightmares).

Here is my analysis:

1. In season 1, Nate is emulating his dad in the scene by the lake. He puts in thumb in Jules' mouth, and gets mad when she calls him the f slur. This hits a nerve with him.
2. We know that Nate's viewing of the tapes happens at a young age. But he is ADDICTED to them, even as a teenager.
3. There is enough evidence to think that Nate is getting off on the tapes his dad has. The CD of his dad having sex with Jules is in a book in his room. Additionally, we see Nate masturbating to his own reflection after his sex with Maddy gets cut short.
4. In the dream sequence, Nate becomes Jules. His dad is intimate with him, but the intimacy isn't the same rough manner with Jules. Even though it's a short scene, there is a sense of connection there.
5. When Nate has a meltdown after the football game and the fight with his dad, he is put back in the place of the nightmare. **However, we know that the nightmares are not violent, they are symbolic, and Nate is traumatized by the closeness of his dad.**

I believe that Nate is jealous of Jules and the proximity she's had to his dad. Nate has become emotionally unavoidable and sees sex and power as the only way to connect with people. Because of this, Jules has connected with his father in a way that he never will. This is not to say that he's attracted to his dad, more that he's envious of what he thinks is real connection (sex).

Additionally, Nate is obsessed with the tapes because he sees himself in his dad, but more because it gives him a sense of connection with him. Their relationship is cold and almost non-existent except for random flare-ups. But think about it, Nate sees connection in the form of power and sex. Seeing his dad engage in the same ""connection"" makes him feel more connected to him by proxy.

This connection then manifests itself into the nightmare. The connection ""by proxy"" warps into a direct connection in Nate's mind, where his dad is having sex with him. This recurring nightmare has no doubt made Nate afraid of penises, men as a whole, and any slightly ""masculine"" features on a woman. Nate is terrified that these nightmares mean he is gay, or even worse, sexually attracted to his dad. **But in truth, he needs his dad. He needs his father. These nightmares are the only way he can have him. Because the tapes are the only way he's ever known his father.**

Edit: I realize I left out the arrest scene. I believe that Nate was battling with these feelings, and felt like getting his dad locked up was the only solution. Out of sight, out of mind. Which is why the other option (killing him), was also on his mind. However, I think ultimately the fake connection Nate feels because of the tapes is the reason he didn't kill his dad. He wants a hug, he wants love. He clings to that feeling, even though he wants him gone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uswbjb/a_deep_dive_into_nates_relationship_to_jules_and/,uswbjb,Affectionate_Arm3040,41,1652938463.0,0.89,11

10. Ethan= the only crime he committed was being boring but he didn't do anything bad the whole show

9. McKay= hasn't done much except taking Cassie for granted

8. Lexi= the play showed she had a darkside but she's really sweet but she doesn't really try to help rue get clean but to be fair rue is her favorite person and doesn't want to let her go and she is just a kid.

7. Ash= killer, bad temper but he's a genuinely a loving person he loves rue and doesn't want to see her hurt but most of the times he has done something bad he was panicked and trying to protect his family.

6. Fez= unethical profession but he's a very caring person 

5. Ali= bad temper and bad past but he's trying to make up for it by helping rue but he needs to work on himself a bit.

4. Cassie/Jules= both don't feel regret for what they have done both are cheaters and Jules has helped to ruin someones life 

3. Rue= I love rue but she is capable of murder and she's done a lot of bad things she has robbed people, hurt people but she's just damaged and has went through more than probably anyone on the show she does have a good heart though.

2. Cal= cheater, crazy, abusive and is a predator and is a bad person

393,The Love Triangle is Not What You Think.,"S2 had a lot of questionable writing decisions, especially with Rue, Elliot, and Jules‚Äôs relationships. While I do think some criticism is deserved, something people are seemingly misunderstanding is what Jules and Elliot represent in relation to Rue and her addiction. 

Jules refuses to enable Rue and be with her while she‚Äôs actively using. Jules represents recovery and the sacrifices Rue has to make during that process. Jules‚Äô airy demeanor, ethereal styling, and bike-riding imagery in s1 juxtaposed with her edgier expression physically and emotionally, and strong sense of boundaries/expectations in s2 (when Elliot comes into the picture) are reflections of the two sides of Rue‚Äôs potential sobriety: goodness, clarity, and freedom in longevity, but pain and darkness temporarily. 

While being with Jules, aka getting sober, is the best choice for Rue, it is the more difficult one.

Elliot represents the easy choice; making no change. The foundation of their relationship is being bump buddies; drugs are how they met and why they kept hanging out. 

Elliot‚Äôs actions throughout s2 are sneaky, his intentions are questionable, and his motivations are unreadable. This isn‚Äôt a writing critique‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs intentional. He is a mirror to Rue. At her worst, in the depths of her addiction, she lies, steals, and cheats. She only does what‚Äôs best for her in the moment and has no regard for anything or anyone else. She screws over Jules and does drugs with Elliot behind her back. 
Since she has someone to get high with now, who has no concerns of getting sober themselves let alone concerns about her sobriety, Rue‚Äôs willing to put her and Jules‚Äô (aka her and sobriety‚Äôs) relationship in jeopardy.

Jules‚Äô and Elliot‚Äôs relationship represents the clashing of Rue‚Äôs two potential choices. Jules and Elliot wouldn‚Äôt have bonded and then slept together if Rue hadn‚Äôt kept doing drugs with him. Again, Elliot, and therefor drugs, staying in her life directly threatens her and Jules‚Äô (aka sobriety‚Äôs) relationship. If she found out Jules slept with Elliot it would be over, and she would have no reason to get sober.  The complexity and fragility of the entire love triangle is symbolic of how complex and fragile Rue‚Äôs relationship with addiction/sobriety is.

EDIT: I definitely agree with a majority of the comments. This is less of a concrete answer to why this love triangle exists, and more of a theory. Again, there were many questionable writing decisions that make this analysis difficult to prove, but in the grand scheme of things I believe this is what they were going for. It definitely was not executed as well as it could‚Äôve or should‚Äôve been. Thank you for all of your comments, they‚Äôve been interesting to read, and thank you for the awards!!

396,What was Nate's actual end goal with Maddy and Cassie?,"I've been thinking about what it was Nate ACTUALLY wanted in this love triangle situation. I think most people probably assume he wanted Maddy back, right? Maddy appears to be the girl he cares about more. She's definitely the one he's giving the full court press when it comes to attention and time.

But, if it had worked, where did he envision everything going from there? If Maddy had taken him back, is he assuming Cassie will keep quiet forever? Is he gambling that her friendship with Maddy is too important for her to blow everything up? It seems a little risky considering she's openly threatened him with telling Maddy already, and that's without him further betraying her by blatantly choosing Maddy over her. He's gotta suspect that if he and Maddy get back together for real, Cassie is going to go scorched earth. Especially as she's deluded herself that she'd have altruistic reasons for it, since she'd be ""protecting"" Nate and Maddy from each other.

There was  truly NO WAY he was going to emerge from this unscathed, so why did he keep pushing forward? Was he just not even thinking of what happens next if he DID get Maddy back? Why didn't he stick to his initial plan of ending things with Cassie immediately, so that even if they HAD been found out, they probably could've said it was a drunken one-time thing and they were both recently broken up and lonely, so...MAYBE forgivable?

I'm just saying, that for someone that much of this sub considers to basically be a sociopath not capable of feeling anything, it feels remarkably sloppy on his part.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/urxhcc/what_was_nates_actual_end_goal_with_maddy_and/,urxhcc,amara90,14,1652824566.0,0.82,22

399,I think the portrayal and conversation around drugs in this show is pretty accurate.,"I am not necessarily talking about Ashtray being 13and selling drugs or the excessive partying. But when I heard Rue talking about being high in the first episode as ""the world went silent and I felt safe inside my own head"", I was struck. This hit home. I always heard Euphoria as glamorizing drug addiction but I wanted to give it a shot by myself. 

And these are the words that I've been searching for to describe being high for a long, long time.
As Rue, I've always had panic attacks and neurological disorders. Same as Rue the ""Euphoria"" of drugs is also the feeling I've been searching for, for as long as I can remember. 

I've been on Adderall, Weed, Lean, assortment of prescriptions, before moving on to harder drugs. I'll never ever forget the first I took MDMA, it gave me that feeling. I could never forget how I felt when I tried it on for the first time. After that and a couple of blunts, I started to not see, not think...its just silence. Felt like it heightened my emotions but only the ones I wanted.

I think the glamor comes from the show in itself. The lightings, the acting, the outfits, makeup and relationships even the toxic ones.

406,"Do you guys actually think that the way this show portrays drug use is accurate at all, especially when these characters are supposed to be in high school?","It's never explicitly stated where this show is supposed to take place but my first assumption was that it was just somewhere near L.A. but after watching the show, it's hard to say. There isn‚Äôt a ton of gang violence, or any type of violence to any degree that isn‚Äôt directly related to the acquisition or selling of drugs and the neighborhood the characters are shown to be in is very suburb-y and don‚Äôt fit in the ‚ÄúL.A. aesthetic‚Äù that's typical in shows portraying the same constructs. I'm just saying that most other shows where drugs are a huge part of it are based around that area because it's known for that type of activity but, if Euphoria isn't based in LA it's very hard to say whether or not they meant for the show to be realistic or not.

407,Lexi's play,"just finished watching the season 2 finale. lexi is now one of my least favorite characters. how did the writers manage to make one of the most relatable and realistic people in the show a ""not like other girls"" mary sue archetype?

the whole lexi play thing was so poorly executed. idk how this was supposed to be seen as an empowering move for her when so much of it was just about making fun of cassie and lowkey slutshaming her. not just that but it was so weird of her to include rue's drug addiction and her father's death as key points in the play without even letting rue know that she was including them. the writers made it out that rue was super proud of lexi but considering the fact that rue was freshly in recovery and the whole school was watching it would make sense for her to be upset or even triggered by seeing her dad's funeral or her relapse recreated.

it was majorly messed up for her to not even bother asking permission from the people her whole play was about. the whole idea just seemed so babyish too. oh let me get look alikes of my friends, switch up their names slightly and then literally RECREATE ALL OF SEASON 1? it was giving middle school girl revenge fantasy against her meanie friends. none of you paid attention to me so i'm airing out everyone's shit and you'll feel so bad for ignoring me boo hoo. a better alternative would be to write an original story with some subtle similarities to real life characters or maybe an overarching lesson or idea that was relevant to her situation and feelings. but no lets literally spoon feed the audience both real and fictional by SPELLING IT OUT YES MARTA MADDY SAME SAME DO YOU GET IT YET?

and that scene with her and fezco where she talked about being worried that cassie would be upset just comes across as even more disingenuous in hindsight seeing how she included that carousel scene for NO REASON. lexi wasn't even there when it happened! how did something so embarrassing and traumatizing for cassie have ANY effect on lexi  for her to make cassie have to live through the humiliation again?? it was just to reinforce the ""cassie is a bimbo"" arc to make herself look better.

and i hated how the confrontation happened. all the emotion and nuance was taken away from the finale just for the gag of watching cassie make a fool of herself on stage and having maddy beating the shit out of her. cassie was obviously in the wrong for the whole of this season but the stuff she said to lexi about her judging all of them was actually completely true. but since the writers need one clear cut evil sister and one sympathetic good sister, lets have her crash the stage. lexi is exempt from all accountability because cassie is such a mess hahahaha look she ruined the play and now she's having a breakdown in front of the whole school lol.

a better route would have been to let the play run its course and have cassie and lexi argue in private afterwards and then maybe have maddy intervene and let their conversation be real and emotional and raw and not just a cheap catfight.

in conclusion none of the stuff i expected for lexi happened. her finally standing up to rue for using her, them having an actual conversation about growing apart, exploring whether or not they're even similar enough to go back to being friends. also the fact that her mom did not show the slightest remorse watching the play when lexi feeling overlooked was HER PARENT'S FAULT  not cassie's. but yeah that was never addressed either",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uqi2at/lexis_play/,uqi2at,Safe-Bedroom2525,217,1652656307.0,0.86,70
408,I really want Season 3 to give us a more in depth relationship between Rue and Maddy.,We‚Äôve had very little interactions between them and they‚Äôre so completely different from one another that I feel they would have an interesting dynamic.,https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uqozny/i_really_want_season_3_to_give_us_a_more_in_depth/,uqozny,Strange_Shadows-45,56,1652680758.0,0.93,10
409,Why Jules is a consistently written Character in Season 2.,"To start off, I'm not justifying Jules' actions or defending the writers room for cutting her screentime and sidelining her for Rue's/Nate's story in season 2. Jules is a flawed character who cheated on Rue with Elliot and it's wrong but still makes sense (to me) as something she'd do.

One go-to quote that people reference when wanting to criticize her hypocrisy, is the one that directly reveals her relationship with men in the second special episode and how it has evolved after exploring her queerness. In that episode Jules monologues how  ""I feel like I've framed my entire womanhood around men. When in reality, I'm no longer interested in men"".

On it's own, the quote does get the idea across that Jules might not be attracted to men after her deep relationship with Rue and Anna. But the entire quote shifts what the point of her comment was:

""Like, Philosophically. Like, what men want. What men want is so boring, and simple, and not creative and I look at myself and I'm like, how the fuck did I spend my entire life building this, like my body, and my personality, and my world around what I think men desire? It's just, like, it's embarrassing. I feel like a fraud"".

This point leads me to believe that her struggle with men is not about her romantic nature with them, it's purely about their interests and how compatible she can be with a man on a spiritual level. Jules no longer centers the validity of her womanhood around what men expect of her. 

In season 1, Jules personal style tells the quiet story of this transformation. Jules starts off hyper-feminine with a soft colorful palette. As the season goes on, her colors transform to dark greens and reds while her wardrobe is less and less conventional. In season 2, Jules has shorter hair and her style is much edgier. Her transformation means that men no longer come into the equation. If she is going to get the attention of a man, it now means that they would have to get around who Jules has become and not what they want her to be. 

This is why Jules is quickly drawn to Elliot. She is not (mainly) drawn in by the attention he gives her or by his flirtatious nature. Jules is intrigued that Elliot is interested in her BECAUSE of her style. The comments about her fascinating personality and her short hair win her over because it's what she's always desired. His casual indifference to her sexual history is also liberating to her. In season 1 episode 4, we see how Jules checked all the boxes for the perfectly conventional girl, but it wasn't enough for men to form an interest with her beyond sex and the fetishization of her trans body. Men always had to assure themselves that they were heterosexual when around Jules. 

Elliot not only meets the bar (the bar is low) for treating her with genuine interest, but he pays attention to her characteristics and makes a connection with the person Jules is on a deeper level. 

Note how with Nate (a conventionally masculine character), Jules being trans is always brought up when discussing his attraction towards her. With Elliot, it doesn't matter and is never brought up because he has made that clear himself without directly stating it. It's simple, their relationship is uncomplicated because it doesn't matter to either of them and that's what Jules is attracted to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uqk5ww/why_jules_is_a_consistently_written_character_in/,uqk5ww,Staff-Positive,111,1652663373.0,0.94,22

422,I Liked Lexi's Play,"So when the play first aired there was so much negativity surrounding it, but I ended up watching it again and I really liked it. I feel like I noticed a lot more nuance the second time around, and where I was initially confused about the fantasy elements, this time I found its implementation beautiful. Most people are chalking the play up to it basically being a revenge fantasy, where Lexi shames people for their trauma or has the sole purpose of humiliating Cassie, but I disagree. 

The play itself is obviously not a situation that translates directly to real life, but I thought it worked fine in the confines of the show. Nobody in the theater knew that the play was based on real life (save the MCs), so it gave the characters (and us) a chance to look back at their lives and Lexi a way to talk about her trauma. I don't take the play super literally; above all, it was just a creative storytelling device that included fantasy elements.

My favorite part was the stuff about Rue; at first I didn't understand why Lexi included the stuff about Rue's dad's death and her addiction, but in the end it came together great. If you would never speak to Lexi again than fine, but this is a fictional show and I felt like there was a much bigger picture behind Lexi's actions. In real life, an addict is usually always seen as some dirty addict, regardless of if they are sober or not. But in the play, I thought Lexi showed so much empathy to Rue; Lexi validated Rue's grief, said she wasn't mad, and that she missed her; it showed Rue that she didn't have to hate herself. I could feel the love that Lexi had for Rue, and I haven't felt that with any other friendship in the show. I definitely thought Lexi's compassion was Sam Levinson drawing from his own hopes for how people would view addiction.

When it comes to Cassie, there were definitely moments where Lexi spoke her mind, but nothing that made me uncomfortable to watch. As far as Lexi ""exposing"" Cassie, I didn't find that. From the way people talk, I would have thought Hallie was simply going to be written as some big tittied whore that had a reputation, cheated, and needed an abortion, but for the most part Hallie was just a pretty blond cheerleader; that's pretty normal and not super specific to Cassie. There where also moments that humanized Cassie, such as Lexi sympathizing with the issues Hallie had because of her body and Hallie comforting Marta (which ties back into the theme of friendship)

The only thing I didn't like was the carousel scene; I know it was probably just a callback for us, but I didn't like how it made Lexi seem suddenly omniscient when everything else in the play was vague. However, this whole play was a mix of fantasy and reality; in the same way the play wasn't as grand as it seemed, Grace wasn't actually called ""Lexi,"" and Kat wasn't actually camming on stage, I don't think Hallie was actually acting all horny on the pony. It was just Cassie projecting onto the character; she sees Hallie acting like that because deep down that is how she views *herself* and she knows that other people do too. Imo, that whole situation said a lot more about how Cassie views herself and how she is willing to humiliate herself for a man than people are giving credit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uplrsf/i_liked_lexis_play/,uplrsf,The_Proponent,104,1652548414.0,0.91,21

Or maybe a play that doesn't go on for 168 hours straight? Is anybody in the audience except the main characters even actually sentient? Seems like they're NPCs that just clap and cheer and occasionally act indignant while Lexi acts as their ventriloquist.

What exactly was the point of this scene anyway? Oh, it's a metaphor! Perhaps a mirror that channels Lexi's underlying passive aggressive and patronizing narcissism for her ignorant townie peers? Or it's a kaleidoscopic narrative device of a ""lived experience"" that inevitably ends with Lexi getting into debt from an overpriced MFA in NYC?

431,Sending hate to real people because they hate your favourite character is not okay.,"Alright so I'm not about to act like a victim or anything, you can even disagree if you like, but it's truly weird how sensitive people on this sub are towards someone not liking their favourite character on the show. 


So I hate Lexi, who is a fictional character btw and i don't think I'm hurting anyone by expressing my intense dislike towards her, but I have lost count of how many times people get aggravated and turn to verbally attack me as a person which shouldn't be fine I guess? The most recent in all this is this one random user who used to keep engaging in comments section earlier and after weeks they are now sending colorful words to my inbox because of me not liking lexi which prompted me to write this post.


There are countless people who don't like the characters I like and I have never sent them any hate for that, it's incredibly immature to do that. It would have been one thing if my opinion was harming a real person but it literally means nothing lol. And then there are people in the comments section acting like I killed their puppy. There was this one person few weeks ago in the comments section covertly expressing they hope my plane crashes because they were supposedly so hurt by my mean comments towards a 'not real' character.

Lexi stans have got to be the most toxic fanbase here and if it wasn't so problematic I'd even joke that it's kind of fitting you like her so much lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uowfsr/sending_hate_to_real_people_because_they_hate/,uowfsr,sharkseahasapun,405,1652461766.0,0.92,104

433,i think lexi is mid,"now before everyone hates me let me explain. i think lexi is mid for two reasons, one because the way she got off scot free for her play(minus cassie) wouldn‚Äôt happen irl because if you noticed all of that and talked/ made a play about it, the amount of blacklash you would have gotten would be insane.

second thing is the actress who played lexi to me isn‚Äôt as interesting as hunter or zendaya, maybe it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs new(er) to acting but i felt her character kinda flat and at the end of the day she is a nepotism child. 

again no hate to the actress just my opinion for watching the show, i think she has so fantastic moments but is overhyped.

458,this show is too dark for me but i can‚Äôt leave it,"okay so here‚Äôs a rant

a few months back, clips from the show were trending on tiktok and reels heavily and EVERYBODDDYYYY was talking about it. 

so i decided to watch. 
five minutes in, i didn‚Äôt feel good with i was watching, it gave me negative vibes and i just tuned off.

context: i am over 18, i have watched shows in the same genre with lots of sensitive content (13rw, elite, etc)

but something about the show was just not making me feel okay. 

then in the last couple of weeks i decided to start watching again because i really didn‚Äôt have any other good show in my list. made it through the first few episodes fine. but then i started to feel peer pressure? 

like why are all of them only into one thing and i literally feel like i don‚Äôt know any 15/16 year olds who act like that. (at least where i‚Äôm from)

i kind of felt insecure that my teenage is not filled with sex, drugs, late nights and fuck ups??? like how ridiculous does it sound 

took a break from the show and realized that all these high school dramas show the same storyline and exaggerated teenage activities. everything is so extreme and for what?

but now i really wanted to know what happens next and the aesthetic of it all is pretty cool ngl, so i continued and finished the first season.

but does anyone else feel that this show promotes this kind of lifestyle amongst teenagers and romanticizes it, even if the message is that it‚Äôs wrong and it fucks up your life?

honestly i just wanna watch some relatable shit and not be forced to believe that i need to be fucked up at my age

464,Why 90% of the euphoria fandom is stupid,"‚ÄòAnd even if I got clean today no one would forget the trauma of me not being clean, but I really regret what I said to Ali‚Ä¶ reducing someone‚Äôs life to a moment, an ugly moment and punishing them for it. That‚Äôs what cops do, it‚Äôs actually what everyone does, it‚Äôs what you would do to me if you didn‚Äôt know me‚Äô - Rue Bennet ‚Äòseason 2 episode 6 

Rewatching the whole show again, on this watch I noticed the theme of not judging people to be so much more prevalent. Especially in Rues special episode in the diner with Ali. This makes the whole virtue signalling, character judging shit that goes on in the fandom so much more, confusing to me. But what I think is so interesting is that the philosophy of the fandom and the philosophy of the show is so different, like Sam and the show constantly preach this notion of forgiveness and love and understanding, while the fandom seem to live this sjw, twitter virtue signalling philosophy that‚Äôs kind of like ‚Äòcancel! Cancel! Cancel‚Äô in the name of ‚Äòprogression‚Äô but without actually thinking anything through or trying to approach such ideas with any semblance of understanding, sympathy or empathy (kind of sounds like Nate when you think about it, lol maybe he‚Äôs been representing sjws or twitter stans all long). 

Anyway this show is great and I think maybe some people need to stop watching it with such a judgmental eye Sam has clearly tried to write all of the children/teens with major flaws and immoralities. You‚Äôre not supposed to look up to them or want to be like the I think you‚Äôre supposed to go on a journey with them to adulthood and being a good person.

467,An eating disorder plot line would‚Äôve fit in well with Cassie *TW*,"They wanted to give Kat one right? They were already toying with the idea of introducing an ED in the show. I think it would‚Äôve fit much better with Cassie. She did have a ton going on already, so obviously they would‚Äôve had to cut some other shit out.    
    
Eating disorders aren‚Äôt simply just about body image. It would make sense that she would have one to regain some control in her life. A lot of people who suffer from ED have had major family issues and fluctuations in their life. I personally think they should‚Äôve introduced it after new years. She‚Äôs actively trying to gain Nate‚Äôs attention, she‚Äôs starting to morph into Maddy. Maddy has a different body type than her and is skinnier.    
    
Along with trying to do her hair, makeup, and outfits like Maddy I can also see her trying to get a more similar body to Maddy. Especially from a teenage girls perspective, she may view herself as just ‚Äúbigger‚Äù rather than curvier. They could‚Äôve introduced it in her morning routine sequences. Shower, shaving, rolling her face, step on the scale, etc. Day after day. Maybe Lexi noticing her throwing her dinner away, looking at food labels. Just subtle stuff like that.

They had discovered the name when they watched a true crime documentary on Elizabeth Bathory's bloody rampage, and one of her many minions was named Fizcko, and it just sounded cool.

475,Nate and Cassie in Season1,"I've been rewatching S1, and I had genuinely forgotten that there are a couple moments with Nate and Cassie that fit pretty well with everything that went down in S2.

In 1x1, McKay straight out accuses him of being into Cassie, ""I'm just saying, I think you dig Cassie."" Nate actually doesn't deny it, saying ""It's irrelevant whether I like her or not.""

Then in the carnival ep, Nate is CLEARLY shit stirring by putting McKay on the spot by trying to get him to own up to being in a relationship with Cassie. And Cassie absolutely knows it, and they focus on Nate smirking at her and her glaring back, basically silently communicating with each other right in front of McKay.

All this to say, I would bet when McKay found out about Cassie/Nate, his first thought was probably ""I knew it."" Because Nate was WAY too invested in breaking those two up, and if I were McKay, I'd assume now it was to snatch Cassie away from me (I don't think it was, Nate is just an ass).

Let me just say, I do not in any way think this was planned. It's just sort of funny looking back at how differently those scenes play now in hindsight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uluq8v/nate_and_cassie_in_season1/,uluq8v,amara90,39,1652112634.0,0.95,11

489,A Slightly Different Perspective On Laurie,"One thing I see repeatedly brought up on this sub is the apparent inevitability of Laurie coming back in season 3 and Rue's unpaid debt to her becoming a major if not her main plot for the season. I think this is somewhat misguided and I worry that the continued acceptance of this prediction as confirmed fact is going to leave many viewers disappointed for what in my opinion aren't entirely the right reasons.

Firstly, I want to touch on how likely it is that Laurie will or won't have a major presence in season 3 based on the hints dropped within the show. Let's start with obviously S2E5. This episode shows Rue revealing to Laurie that she isn't able to pay her back and Laurie in turn attempting to kidnap Rue for trafficking purposes, with Rue quietly escaping in the night. I think this incident alone should be acknowledged as a solid example of Rue seeing consequences for her actions, even if they're not necessarily fitting how short sighted and risky Rue's decision to borrow the drugs was; she's obviously fully aware of what Laurie was going to do to her, and that near miss with being sold into human trafficking may as well be a near death experience, rock bottom. With that said I think that there's a good to fair chance that this was always the full extent of the plan with the Laurie/Rue subplot; Rue makes a bad call while on drugs, almost pays for it with her life and gets a real glimpse for herself of where she's heading. 

I lean toward this interpretation especially because Faye intentionally reveals Laurie's address and affairs to the police through Custer's phone, giving a pretty easy out for Sam to write out Laurie in season 3 and focus the show on its more central character driven themes.

Personally I'd prefer that the show move on from Laurie because I think embroiling it's main character in a breaking bad style drug and human trafficking scheme just wouldn't serve the greater story of the show very well. Euphoria is mostly about today's generation of teenagers navigating severe levels of trauma and mental illness in an internet driven world that poses anxieties and trials that are brand new to them. I don't see how that can exist to its fullest potential with Laurie there taking up the main characters storyline.

Since we get like two seasons a decade, by the time season 3 start most of the actors on the show won't be able to pull of being teenagers. And if not in high school, where will we find the characters? Most of them don't even seem like they would keep in touch, like I see Jules and even Maddy leaving town soon after graduation, so what's the storyline that would keep them all connected.  I think that if the show continues past season 3, it will probably be with a new cast, a different group of high schoolers.

I was rewatching a while ago and just caught the repeated lines. There‚Äôs this denial with all of them that what they‚Äôre doing is harmless or can be justified, when each action can lead to a slippery slope. One pill for Rue is another one keeping her an addict, another rendezvous with Nate means more brokenness for Cassie.

520,Cassie went on stage for no other reason than Nate breaking up with her,"When it comes to Cassie walking on stage at the play, people keep saying ""Cassie's reaction to the play was justified"" but the only reason Cassie walked on stage was because Nate broke up with her. She didn't care about Lexi or feel hurt about what she said about her in the play. Instead of admitting Nate dumped her because he just didn't care about her, Cassie wanted somebody to blame, so she went up on stage to destroy Lexi because Lexi took away what she valued more than anything: male validation.

I also can't get behind people saying that Cassie was right to go on stage and berate Lexi about how easy her life is. To me, it further exemplified Cassie's inability to understand that people process trauma differently. We saw in episode 6 how she wrote Rue off as a bad person who didn't have any reason to be a drug addict because she (Cassie) herself wasn't one and she also didn't have a dad. Then, during the play, Cassie goes on stage and completely dismisses any feelings that Lexi has because Lexi isn't acting the way that Cassie herself is, even though they both lost a dad and have trauma because of it.

I guess this is unpopular, but I definitely felt like Cassie walking on stage continued to show that Cassie will humiliate herself for a man and choose them over everything in her life, this time her own sister.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/ui9o70/cassie_went_on_stage_for_no_other_reason_than/,ui9o70,The_Proponent,534,1651679463.0,0.94,82

536,Cassie is more of a ‚Äúnice girl‚Äù than Lexi,"  I saw someone tweet out that ‚ÄúLexi is a pick me and a nice girl who dresses ‚Äònot like the other girls‚Äô she‚Äôs fake,‚Äù yeah that‚Äôs not true. Lexi has her own personality: she loves art, theater, she genuinely cares for her friends and she‚Äôs creative. 
  
  Her clothing represents her ‚Äúintellectual style‚Äù and wallflower personality; while quiet sometimes, she has a very loud imagination, especially when dealing with the trauma in her family and her friends drifting away. While a bookworm, she has her own sense of fashion, her own personality and it‚Äôs by her choice alone. I personally love this style, it‚Äôs warm colors, cute and vintage too.

    Cassie is the ULTIMATE ‚Äúnice girl‚Äù, her personality and fashion choices depend on which guy she wants to impress. She treats Lexi poorly, is very selfish and ignores her for most of the time; she slept with Nate: her friend Maddy‚Äôs abusive and manipulative ex boyfriend even after knowing that he made fun of her plenty of times, repeatedly breaks up with Maddy and is rumored to be secretly repressing his sexuality. Even in season 1, she acts sweet and naive towards both McKay and Daniel, it‚Äôs almost like a fake ‚Äúgirl next door‚Äù act. Her clothes are basic, even the colors on them symbolize her recurring toxic traits: pink (hyper femininity) blue (sadness) white (fake innocence and her having terrible ideas on what is actually love and what love is) she has no personality of her own and even tells Nate ‚Äúyou can control what I wear/who I talk to and what I eat.‚Äù Nate in episode 4 even calls her out on her fake ‚Äúgood and sweet‚Äù behavior, when she‚Äôs sleeping with him.

      When Nate broke up with Cassie and kicked her out of his house, instead of being mad at Nate and herself, she then takes her anger out on Lexi and bullies her on stage, in front of the whole school and assaults a random actress who was re-enacting her carousel moment; I don‚Äôt think the whole school knew about that, but it reveals how Cassie wants to be seen as the ‚Äúnice, sweet pretty girl next door‚Äù instead of the flaky, selfish, fake cheating liar with an ugly personality who craves attention and like a spoiled brat throws a tantrum when she doesn‚Äôt get her way.

       Even looking at her clothing when she‚Äôs around her mom, Lexi and her friends which is at home (and everyone else is dressed nicely, even Lexi). Sweatshirt, sweatpants and hair not done or put in a ponytail. When she‚Äôs around a boy which is when McKay or Nate shows up she‚Äôs dressed more nicely  with makeup and curled hair while wearing skirts. It‚Äôs an act she puts up around men.

     Cassie is an exaggerated but satirized version of a ‚Äúpick me‚Äù and a ‚Äúnice girl.‚Äù She‚Äôll bully her own sister, lie to her own friends and beat up a random girl when she‚Äôs upset, but when she wants male attention she‚Äôll put on an act of being ‚Äúgood, sweet and nice.‚Äù Pretty and soft on the outside, but dark, cold and ugly on the inside when it suits her.


*Note: Cassie mentions how she falls in love, takes risks and gets hurt-knowing what she‚Äôs doing is unhealthy and dangerous, especially trying to appeal towards guys who are clearly bad for her and putting herself in risky sexual situations, when clearly understanding that she‚Äôs getting hurt but still wants the attention from terrible guys: the mystery guy who leaked her nudes, McKay being embarrassed about their relationship, Daniel who only used her for sex and who she cheated on McKay with and Nate, a known abuser. Yet she still wants to be ‚Äúloved‚Äù by them even when it‚Äôs hurting her. She‚Äôd be sad that she lost their attention, but angry and then be violent towards girls and threaten them who call her out on her toxic behavior or make her mad: Lexi, Maddy and the random girl. ‚ÄúPick me‚Äù girls are known to hate other women and take their jealousy and anger out on them, Cassie is an over the top exaggeration of a ‚Äúpick me‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that she picks and chooses who to show her angrier and messier sides with, mostly other girls. From Maddy, her sister and even her mom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uhhn0m/cassie_is_more_of_a_nice_girl_than_lexi/,uhhn0m,MistakeWonderful9178,14,1651588933.0,0.59,30

542,Ali from an 12-Step Perspective,"First, I want to preface this by saying that I love Ali‚Äôs character and he represents so much. I am just interested to hear thoughts about this‚Ä¶

In actual 12-Step meetings (AA, NA, etc.), it is very important that men and women work separately. It is a community so everyone befriends, shares, and connects with each other, yes, but I can‚Äôt think of a single reason why it would be appropriate for a grown man to sponsor a newly sober 17-year-old girl. From a 12-Step perspective, he shouldn‚Äôt even be talking to her outside of meetings.

Most fellowships wouldn‚Äôt allow this or at least strongly advise against it because it is often a 13th stepping situation. I understand Ali is not like that and he is helpful, but I worry about the show promoting this. Rue having lost her father and him acting like a paternal figure only makes it more concerning.

Also, please stop shipping Leslie and Ali. Especially if Ali is becoming Rue‚Äôs sponsor. That is so inappropriate and detrimental to her recovery.

Edit: 

I have nothing against grown men and women working together in 12-Step settings. I, now a legal adult, have very close friendships with men in the program. 

However, two adults is a very different dynamic than a newly sober 17-year-old girl and a old-timer grown man. 

Even then, I don‚Äôt have an issue with healthy exceptions, as long as viewers understand that it is unfortunately rare and special.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uh0hw0/ali_from_an_12step_perspective/,uh0hw0,omw2fybsry,37,1651527708.0,0.92,20

611,Zendaya and Sydney Sweeney,"I know that this probably doesn't matter. But I was wondering why Sydney Sweeney and Zendaya don't seem like they are close at all. To my knowledge they both barely mention each other in interviews although Sydney has previously talked about practically every member of the cast and likewise for Zendaya. I also notice how they barely comment or like each other's posts on Instagram even though both have liked their fellow cast members such as Maude or Alexa. I feel like for Zendaya she is the closest with Hunter and Maude and for Sydney it looks like she is just the closest with Maude.
