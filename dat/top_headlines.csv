69,Apparently they used a photo of me for the fake INXS album cover in S02E03,"In episode 3 when Cal and his friend put on INXS at the bar, they briefly show an album cover of what’s supposed to be their album Kick, only it’s not.

[Original cover](https://preview.redd.it/xpcp1r8bm4l81.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6a7e15878346e4762d93a484773c7a5970562da)

I got started with season 2 a bit late, so I only found out, when my girlfriend and I was watching the episode the other night.We only see the cover for a second, but it was long enough for my girlfriend to be like “Was that you?”, and while I was fairly certain that was me, I was like, no way that’s possible, that would make no sense at all.My friends always point out random guys with long dark hair and facial hair, saying it’s me, so it’s a joke I’m pretty used to, but still that looked way too similar.We rewind a bit and pause, and holy fuck, that’s me.

[Euphorias fake cover](https://preview.redd.it/oa0d1xocm4l81.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feabd5ad112e857b79362a8cf8fa3a7ac5f09fb)

About 10 years ago I had a single photo shoot for some stock photos, and I’m pretty sure the photos have never been used before, at least I’ve never seen them used, nor heard about it.Yet somehow the production of Euphoria found these stock photos, and for some reason decided using one of them to replace Michael Hutchence.

I still can’t really comprehend that this actually happened, or why, as he doesn’t have any facial hair, and my hair is way darker than his, but it looks like they gave me highlights, so I guess they made an effort. At least they didn’t shave me 🤷‍♂️

Anyways, I just had to share this, because it’s gotta be one of they weirdest things I’ve ever experienced, but also something I’ll never forget.

If necessary, here’s proof of me.

149,"The Musical Number at the End is Making Fun Of Homophobia, Not Being Homophobic.","Ok… so I’m seeing wayyyy too many people interpreting the final scene of S2E7 as homophobic, which hurts because it means you’ve missed the brilliance of the scene. The entire premise of the scene was to hold a mirror up to HS heteronormative jock culture to show that it is littered with homoeroticism. 

The opening to the scene makes this clear when when Ethan’s character slaps the fake Cassie on the butt in this performative act of heterosexuality, prior to jumping into a musical number where the homoeroticism of jock culture is highlighted.

If you pay attention to the crowd the girls who laugh at Nate, do so with regards to his relationship with Cassie and do so before the homoerotic subtext of the musical number is established. Nate feels awkward because of this at first. As the number continues we see Nate’s rage transition and peak at the homosexual nature of the play. 

Furthermore the backup dancers in the scene are alluded to as being gay in the prior backstage scene, which would imply they are in on the joke about toxic masculinity’s homoeroticism.

Also the fact that it highlight’s the entire institution of jock culture not singularly Nate, makes it clear it isn’t a direct attack on him.

Lastly, the only people in the crowd who are aware of Nate’s sexual queerness are the main characters, and their reaction’s say as much. Ie: Rue looking around sheepishly, and Maddie applauding the scene heavily.

It was a brilliant scene because it perfectly critiqued jock culture and allowed for us to see the subtle ways in which someone who’s struggling with their sexual identity might interpret something as an attack on them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/sy81lu/the_musical_number_at_the_end_is_making_fun_of/,sy81lu,Free_Consequence9649,3904,1645486353.0,0.93,784

269,"Maddy Perez is Latina. Denying her ethnicity is white-washing, racist, and super harmful.","I don’t know what it is about this sub, but I’ve seen a few people claim Maddy isn’t hispanic. I don’t even know what to say because it is so obvious, and Alexa Demie is even of Mexican descent. 

Just wanted to put that out here because  it is a form of racism and it should not be tolerated.

EDIT: before you comment, 

• nationality ≠ ethnicity ≠ race

• latina: latin american country, hispanic: spanish speaking

• this isn’t an invitation for discourse about alexa demie’s race, but [here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/tf1vmv/maddy_perez_is_latina_denying_her_ethnicity_is/i0tfjfj/?context=3) a conversation about the word choice “racism” in this context and complexity of race within the latin community. 

• any variation of “why make everything about race” is racist.

• im not virtue signaling, just a latina who stumbled upon a few redditors doing this, got frustrated, and wanted to address the issue. didn’t know it’d blow up like this lol

• yes it’s real, i’ve linked a couple of comments but (1) im not gonna link it here and (2) im not surfing the entirety of this sub to satisfy you, maybe just try not doubting minorities so much when we speak about our issues.

270,"After this week episode, I stopped opiates cold-turkey (I'm at day 5!!!)","Hi everyone,

I just wanted to say that Euphoria was more helpful to me than any ""anti-drugs"" programs in school.

Seeing Rue always fucked up, tired, sleepy and missing things in life really made me reconsider my life choices. The last episode was the straw that broke the camel back. I'm fucking sick of being dependent on a substance. If I don't take my dose every 8 hours, I start to feel like shit...  Actually at work I often go to the toilet to dose. :/

Since the last episode, I flushed what I had and now I'm in withdrawal (day 5 !!!! it's already far better, I don't feel sick anymore beside diarhea and insomnia). This week I got reprimanded by my boss because my productivity was low though... He doesn't know about my addiction so he has no idea that I'm in withdrawal.

I'm really motivated to stop now !! And that's thanks to Euphoria!

&#x200B;

Sadly I will receive a package in a week... But I will flush it as soon as it arrives. It's 350€ worth of products but FUCK IT!! I don't want to restart this shitty cycle, it will cost me more in the long run.

That Elliot and her would just get drunk together while Rue watched? I don’t blame Rue for snapping at Jules over that. Then for Elliot and Jules to drop an obviously fucked up Rue in the middle of nowhere to meander her way home. Who does that? Elliot knew she was fucked up but was more concerned with getting Jules home to have sex with her than he was about his friend’s safety. Not to mention Jules constantly cheating on Rue with Elliot this episode. Why would Jules agree to be with Rue if she’s just gonna turn around and cheat on her?

413,Cal Jacobs' summer of love,"Is it just me, or did you guys find Cal Jacobs' backstory as beautiful as I did? I think the whole 14 something minute opening sequence would make a great short movie. Admittedly, the ending is quite heartbreaking, but the 80s summer vibe, the carefree lightness, and the sexual tension between him and Derek; I really dig it. I wonder how his life would turn out if Marsha didn't get pregnant.

What do you think?

Even if we excuse her exploiting her friends lowest moments, she still has made sure to paint herself as the perfect good girl who can do no wrong, how about we see how you are also flawed Ms Lexi?

470,Am I the only one who thinks that Jules was never really THAT into Rue? I don't see the romance.,"The fans have become attached to rue and jules, and I admit in the beginning I was too, but now, even disregarding all the crap Jules pulled in season 2...I don't even think they were that good of a couple in season 1 and I just don't believe Jules loved rue as much as rue loved Jules. I think Jules loved Rue but in only as a friend. But since Jules loves validation and being loved, she sort of played on rues feelings even if she didn't realize it. But Jules seems more enthusiastic about her cheating hookups with Anna and elliot than she ever did with rue. It seems like her personality shows better with both of those characters as well but when she's with rue, it feels like she has her guard up and it just seems more platonic to me. Which in the special episode it kinda confirms that. Jules feels that if she does something wrong even slightly that rue will relapse. She felt trapped and they barely had any romance. Jules dodged rues kiss one time and they were never really involved sexually which is odd just when you think about how promiscuous Jules is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/tqos4e/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_that_jules_was_never/,tqos4e,,2141,1648518140.0,0.94,178

538,“Please be kinder to Cassie please” 🥺 yet that energy is not given to Maddy who has been violently assaulted and been abused? It’s giving very much white women tears…,"Edit and most important: this post blew up and I didn’t event think to add a trigger Warning for domestic abusive! Basically because I thought nobody would see it. Also nobody can read through all comments and reply including me. 
The most important part is if you are experiencing domestic violence please know it is not your fault. You are never to blame, regardless of peoples opinions or what people are telling you. You are deserving of empathy regardless of how you handle the situation. It’s not just some plot on some show, it’s a real life situation for a lot of people and I’m sorry for anyone that has been triggered by the depiction of Nate’s abusive. 

Edit: I think we underestimated the amount of naive people that view this show. Considering they thought Laurie after, injecting rue with morphine, was “helping” her. I also didn’t take into account the hate Jules was getting too. I think peoples implicit bias are really standing out.

Oh down vote me all you want, Cassie is giving very much single white female. Sydney Sweeney is obviously a great actor…

Look it’s one thing too be young and be insecure and place male validation above all else to have your problems and lack of guidance and do the wrong thing and sleep with someone you shouldn’t… but she know what this man has put Maddy through, violence and abuse. Maddy was absolutely a shell of herself. She slept and has be friended someone’s abuser? SOMEONES ABUSER? And she also has people around her the honest about her behaviour.

Now if maddy did all this would you tell people to be kinder? Hmmm I wonder…

EDIT: wow I had no idea there were so many violent abuse apologist all because they are “bOtH fLaWeD gIrLs” y’all are the same as the ones who though Laurie was helping rue. Don’t get butthurt at the truth which is that Cassie is sleeping with her best friends ABUSER. Being flawed is definitely part of the show but people are forgetting a very serious and true fact that Cassie is sleeping with maddys violent abuser. Just say you are intimidated by upfront WOC and leave. 

Edit: OMFG if everything I saw was supporting maddy? I wouldn’t have made the post??? Lmao I’ve seen people defend Cassie, down play the situation and complete skip over that his abusive and that Cassie knows about it to and extent. Y’all really want to pretend like that’s not happening that’s ok… I can’t reply too everyone saying the same thing. I have seen it. I’m not the first too make a post about it or even a tik tok. Don’t bother commenting for the millionth time “I haven’t seen anyone excuse Cassie” if you haven’t seen it good for you. I didn’t make the post out my ass and I’m not the first to make it either so I can’t even take credit.

631,Ashtray Doesn't Exist,"> In another interview of Walton circulating the internet, there’s even more speculation his character could come back. “It’s not confirmed that Ashtray is dead,” said the actor (via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lollwt28/status/1498647665760178177?s=21)). “It looks like he got shot, but he’s one bad kid. He might still be alive out there — you never know.”   


This is of course is silly (in fact preposterous) - because even if Ashtray and Fezco are alive for Season 3, they are both facing multiple life sentences in prison. Ashtray will be tried as an adult, and killing a law enforcement officer is a federal crime. So probably the Supermax in Florence Colorado for both of them.

**The thing I find the most interesting is that legally/technically, Ashtray doesn't exist.**

We see him using a computer (deftly) at the end of episode 7 (S2), so we can assume he's literate, and probably home schooled. If he at attended kindergarten or elementary school, the schools would want a real, full, name. And of course at some point he would be truant.

We have no idea where grandma picked him up, so no birth certificate, no social security number, no record of any childhood vaccinations, and probably no medical/dental history. If he follows Fezco's motto of ""No social media for me"", he wouldn't have a digital footprint either.

So he'd be one of the rarest people in existence, somebody who is legally a ghost.

Alive or dead, the cops will have one hell of time trying to figure out where he came from - and who he is. Even if he was kidnapped by grandma, that's a cold-case going back 12 or 13 years (2009 or so).

696,Euphoria tends to attract the wrong audience.,"I was watching a review of Euphoria Season 2 by youtuber Mina Le. In this review she went and adressed two of the following points.

- there seem to be no consequences for the other characters that abuse drugs except for rue. Elliot also takes heroin but is perfectly functional. Does it send the message that you can do heroin because it doesn't affect everyone the same? (Btw I don't recall him taking heroin.)

- the concept of Ashtray is crazy because 12 year old drug dealers aren't a commodity and is quite a ridiculous thing to implement in this story.

That's what I have to say about these takes: personally I think they show how a lot of the viewers of the show seem to be sheltered and thus disregard the experience of others. I can totally understand when you think some aspects of a tv show are ridiculous, but these two aspects are a sad reality.

My best friend used to mix drugs for a long period of time and he was just like elliot. He was still hanging out with friends, going to school and all that shit. He wasnt having episodes like rue or nothing. Just doing drugs cause he liked it. The show isnt saying that you should do certain drugs because they dont affect everyone the same way.  Prime example being lexi, that hated how weed made her feel compared to rue, with weed being considered by many to be a ""harmless drug"". 
There are multiple levels when it comes to drug use and they are portrayed in the show. Occasional drug use (when cassie and maddie take molly at the carnival), regular drug use (people that smoke weed almost everyday. I think McKays brothers would qualify, I'm 100% assuming) and addicts, functional and non functional (elliot and rue). The show isnt saying ""yeah do coke because it may have done damage to rue in the new years eve episode but elliot turned out fine"". Thats nonsense.

Now when it comes to her saying ashtray is a ridiculous character, thats where it gets really ignorant. Idk how it is still news to people that children get involved into this business. 50 Cent had to sell crack as a kid. Asap Rocky had to sell crack as a teenager. A kid in chicago that went by Lil Yummy was a gangmember at age 11 and had already murdered people by that age. I knew kids who sold drugs at age 12. I knew kids on drugs at age 13. I can understand when these things seem crazy to you at first, but completely dismissing that as being ridiculous is extremely insensitive and just shows how sheltered you are. 

Everyone is free to watch whatever they want but I feel like some people don't make an effort when it comes to understanding some things that occur in the show. It makes me feel like the show just wasn't made for them. 

I just wanted to share my opinion on this, I'll link the video aswell. Let me know your opinions on the matter!

Do not normalise slut shaming & “she’s a whore!” mentality. and other then that. 

Slut shaming isn’t right. Saying cassie deserves de*th, to be beaten black and blue, hell I’ve even seen people on Twitter wish nate will do the worst on her, no girl deserves that.

804,Unpopular opinion barbie/Kat drama,"Is anyone else super fucking annoyed with the whole Barbie/Kat drama. I’m very irritated with this whole “ shes plus size positive and didn’t want an eating disorder” like okay sure. But it makes sense for her character! every character in the show has an addiction. Rue is addicted to drugs, Cassie is addicted to male validation, Maddy is addicted to luxury and toxic relationships, every single character is addicted to something so why would Kats  character be any different? it ruins the story line when she’s the only other main character with ZERO actual issues/ addictions. If you think about it her whole character since season one has been building up to this. For example when she gained weight as a kid and her boyfriend broke up with her, when she over sexualizes herself Bc she doesn’t feel attractive enough for anything other then sex which  resonates with a lot of young girls. Now her character makes no sense at all. She has zero family issues, zero body issues, zero relationship issues( I can’t even talk about that bs that happened with Ethan). absolutely nothing about her character makes sense. this ridiculous “diva” behavior isn’t helpful at all to the plus size community. WE DO HAVE EATING DISORDERS ( not everyone obviously but it’s very common) it’s not fat phobic to make her character have an eating disorder. it’s realistic for a lot of plus size people AND just teenage girls in general so that excuse makes zero sense. it all boils down to being unprofessional in my opinion. 

Actors literally have had to get therapy before and after a role because it was so intense and yet she’s throwing a fit about having an eating disorder ON A TEEN SHOW ABOUT ADDICTIONS. why would you Audition for a role about teen addicts and then not expect to have an addiction that fits your character",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/t0fwwy/unpopular_opinion_barbiekat_drama/,t0fwwy,poppyseeded01,1509,1645722374.0,0.89,375

915,Holding Cassie accountable for her actions.,"Cassie was a fan favorite last season because she was a beautiful and sweet girl. She represented the downsides of being the prettiest girl in town: being over sexualized, slut shamed, and treated like an object rather than a person. We also got to explore her dysfunctional family dynamic: an alcoholic mother, absentee addict father, and a resentful sister. All of this ultimately contributed to her need for male validation.


But as tragic  as her character may be, I feel like a lot of Cassie stans are avoiding a difficult realization: Cassie is…kinda a bad person. This love triangle isn’t a one off situation. She spent the entirety of last season cheating on her boyfriend then feeling guilty about it. We thought her abortion (which was her right to have) would be a pivotal moment for her character….But she starts off season two making WORSE decisions than last time.

Nate was TRIPLE off limits. He’s your best friends on-again/off-again boy-friend (strike one). Said boyfriend ABUSED your best friend (strike two), and to make it all worse, he’s McKay’s best friend (strike three).

I hate the “Nate took advantage of her” discourse. Nate is a horrible person so no one expects him to have a moral compass. Regardless, Cassie knew EXACTLY what she was doing. Taking her panties off in the car, saying “I’m soaking wet,” SHE seduced him (Nate isnt shit for even thinking about it). Then when they were in the bathroom she looked happy as hell… But moment Maddy banged on the door she couldn’t stop crying. She KNEW she fucked up. I’m tired of the excuses for her.

I want her to get help because I do like her character and she’s experienced a lot of trauma. However, being traumatized isn’t an excuse to be an asshole to others. You’re not responsible for *being* traumatized, but you are responsible for how you deal with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/s0lkli/holding_cassie_accountable_for_her_actions/,s0lkli,BrokenBlossom77,1375,1641825735.0,0.97,460

925,I feel a little bad for Sydney Sweeney,"This might be an unpopular opinion and that’s okay, but I feel really bad for Sydney. I feel as though her popularity has been really centered around her body. A lot of the photo shoots she’s done are centered around her boobs and not from who she really is or her talent?? All for boobies, love love love boobies but also I just really enjoy Sydney as an actress and I want more for her than just to be the new blonde sex symbol of the media. I literally saw people get upset about an outfit she wore because it wasn’t as revealing as normal, and they were worried she got a boob reduction?? like chill???? 

***EDITED for typos***
EDIT 2: I really need to preface this is not a post to shame Sydney Sweeney in any sense


last edit: Some of y’all need to learn the difference between Sydney wanting to do nude scenes and be confident in her body (WHICH IS AMAZING) and the disgusting objectification by media and fans that we are discussing. I mean just go to the subreddit dedicated to her and you’ll seen some really disturbing things. The majority of you get the point of this post and I love the conversation that is coming out of it, but the other 20% is shaming sydney or assuming that this post is angry she has boobs or that I hate the show euphoria which is absolutely not right. Separate the character from the actress. We support women here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uigiaf/i_feel_a_little_bad_for_sydney_sweeney/,uigiaf,slothsrico,1363,1651698119.0,0.96,243

933,This fandom needs to understand that statutory rape is statutory rape even when the victim lied about their age,"If people want to talk so much about how “technically” Cal is innocent because Jules actually lied about her age, then I think they should be reminded that technically, according to the US law, statutory rape is a strict liability crime. It doesn’t matter if he didn’t know Jules’ real age or if she lied to him. The same applies to the Maddy and Tyler situation when people try to defend Tyler saying Maddy lied to him about her age (which I think never happened but I might be remembering incorrectly)",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/t8w40d/this_fandom_needs_to_understand_that_statutory/,t8w40d,a_veryclevername,1351,1646678398.0,0.85,406
