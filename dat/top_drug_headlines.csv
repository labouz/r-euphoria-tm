1,"As an ex-opioid addict, Zendaya's withdrawal scenes are the most realistic portrayal I've ever seen before. her acting is phenomenal.","This episode really showed me how amazing of an actor Zendaya is, I've never seen opioid withdrawal portrayed so realistically in film before. It reminds me so much of when I was going through withdrawal, it's pure hell and desperation, and she captures it so perfectly. She even has it down to the small details like the constant yawning, I've never seen that in a withdrawal scene before. I thought movies like Requiem for a Dream were good at portraying withdrawal, but this just takes it to another level.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/smur2x/as_an_exopioid_addict_zendayas_withdrawal_scenes/,smur2x,EshaySikkunt,2532,1644252587.0,1.0,216

5,"In Lexi’s play, Lexi specifically mentions how getting high made her feel bad but made Rue feel good. So my question is, why? I never had an experience with drugs but I drink so I know alcohol has a different effect depending on the person. I would like to know from if it is also true for drugs.",,https://i.redd.it/fe6lnf73b6n81.jpg,td9tby,,1505,1647186989.0,0.92,415
6,Does anyone actually believe Rue has a 3.95 GPA? And do you think Laurie believed Rue’s plan or she just didn’t care because she’s going to sell her to sex traffickers when she squanders her drugs?,,https://i.redd.it/z53lxo4hd8g81.jpg,slz7wn,Straight_Extension31,1321,1644161068.0,0.97,311
