13,"watching rue in each episode feels like i’m watching my younger sister — we haven’t talked in over 5 years. she’s an addict, beholden to opiates, amphetamines, and anything else in between. our parents were meth addicts and alcoholics, and we had oppositional reactions; i’ve never tried any drugs, and she tried them all. she became addicted, and i resented her for it. i tried to force sobriety into her via shame and she pushed back into it further. then we lost each other. 

this last episode hit me harder than anything else i’ve watched, ever. 

i’m older now, and i wonder what could’ve been with our relationship had i been able to forgive her for the illness she was inflicted with involuntarily, instead of seeing her actions as selfish choices, as re-traumatizing me and betraying our bond. i wonder what an honest and open approach could’ve looked like. i wonder about where she is. i wonder about if i find out she’s died, or if she will pull herself out of this. i wonder about what it’s like to have a sister again. 

the core question: does euphoria make me want to try drugs? no. nothing could make me want to try drugs. but it makes me see my past interactions in a different light. it makes me want to push to be more compassionate towards addiction.",ambientscreaming,52,1644657313.0,hwmidci,sqhl33

I know that I probably should stop watching all together, especially since this topic is so easy to trigger me but it's such a great show and I have fomo.

With that being said, I hope it scares the shit out of anyone who is even slightly curious about opiates. I always told myself that I would never try heroin bc I knew I would like it. I was clean for 3 years. I had a bad week and was originally looking for Lortabs. My friend made me believe that's what we were getting but when he got back in the car, it wasn't Lortabs.

I've been in relationships with people like Rue. Who talked to me the exact way she talked to Jules and her mom and sister. I truly think Euphoria, at least with Rues story, is extremely accurate.

I was getting high at 14 (hydromorphone and morphine regularly) so when I was alone, depressed, fucked up, I felt a little less...suicidal and freakish by being able to watch Skins UK.

51,"Recovering addict here, and I’ve never related more/ seen a better portrayal of the life of an addict than rue in euphoria, it’s really hard to know if you have an addictive personality and if having fun w friends or experimenting w drugs is going to take a hold of you and run your life into the ground until it’s much too late, I was a 3.8 student and got into weed my senior year then moved onto to psychedelics, trying coke and molly then shortly after became hooked on Xanax and then ultimately moved on to opiates and a oxy/ Percocet habit is incredibly expensive and that’s why a majority of opiate users move on to heroin/ fentanyl which is what happened to me, I spent every waking moment focused on getting high and stopped caring about literally anything besides drugs, and once you have a dependence on opiates it’s literally a physical need stronger than the need to eat food or drink water, you’ll do almost anything to avoid withdrawal and it will lead to living a life that is pure hell, when your going through withdrawal your brain thinks your body is dying and the feeling is unlike any pain you can imagine until you’ve been through it, if anyone reading this is considering trying any type of opiate just don’t fucking do it, the truth is that it will feel better than ANYTHING you’ve ever felt before and it will most likely take a hold of you, don’t be like me and think that from past experiences and ego that u can “handle ur drugs” or that ur stronger than it, ur not stronger than opiates and no one is, it won’t be like anything you’ve ever felt and it will take you and turn you into a fiend and a sorry excuse for a person that you and everyone you care about will hate. Living while addicted to opiates is like living with a noose around ur neck that gets tighter everytime you don’t have them and it’s unbearable.

When she described how it slows down and quiets her world that was tempting to hear for someone as me, who is also mentally ill and suicidal and who has popped a few more of my prescription meds a couple times just to get numb or more sleepy.

But second season really made me rethink any temptations. Especially the scenes where Rue does anything just to get some drugs and even steals from friends. Seeing that huge shift in her behaviour is scary. As I have BPD, I could see myself getting addicted. I'm very self-destructive, already suffer with self-harm and hair-pulling so falling for more damaging coping mechanisms is not unrealistic in my case.

423,"Warning to those that do enjoy opiates. Been an addict for over 15 years. ONLY messed around with pills. Never fucked with heroin or tin foil and only ever swallowed or snorted my pills. Always was able to walk away and either take subs for a short time or just stop. Literally did this for 15 years. 

Pandemic hits. No more pills. Good friend/dealer (oxymoronic I kno) tells me about fent and I can just snort like blow. I’m like alright I mean it’s a pharmaceutical and not H. Got a few bags and did lil pinch lines. After a month get on subs within a day of stopping. All good. Get over taking subs and think I’ll do f again and till subs are out of my system then detox the subs for a few days. This time I actually get really into it and actually start nodding out on it(never ever nodded out prior to this except on methadone when went to the clinic for only a month and hated nodding). I actually love nodding out on this stuff it’s so fun. 

First 2 months are fucking awesome I’m on top of the world I feel so amazing and happy. 3rd month: alright gotta nip this in the bud I’m too into it and gotta get my job back. 

First 24 hrs off fent: hah this shit is easy as fuck barely feel any withdrawals.. ok guess it’s been 24 hrs gonna take a 2mg sub… hmm doesn’t do anything. Guess I need more. After 6 mg start feelin really shitty. Probably not enough and am really withdrawing now. Proceed to take 24 MG(please don’t ever do this). Almost die and start hallucinating I am trapped in a castle that is a part of hell and I am being held down by demons while it’s 200 degrees and I’m sweating, can’t stay still, my body feels like I’m being skinned alive over and over again. I start rolling around in my bed spitting on myself convulsing. Do this for about 10 hours. Bf comes home with a bag(he hasn’t quit yet) and after 12 hours of this I’m practically done but I am so fucking sore so I break down and start snorting lines. After 5 to 6 good sized lines I finally feel so much better and normal. Takes 5 days for all that sub to leave my body. 

Took me an entire year after that to get the balls to get into the methadone clinic. I’m almost 4 months clean and my birthday is this Sunday. I feel so much better. Fentanyl is no joke. I did almost overdose once and can tell you all about that or other stories if you want. 

Please beware. I ALWAYS carried narcan with me and sadly I did have to use it on my own mother (she is an addict to ; a huge reason I got into pills(she gave me them everyday since I was 14). 

I have missed so many things in life due to drugs. I am currently in the car while my bf drives us to the clinic as I write this. Love all you guys and please be smart and stay safe.",RiiniiUsagii,1,1644688338.0,hwo69ws,sqhl33

495,"When the first season came out I was already addicted to weed(I know it’s not physically addictive but I have an addictive personality)and had been doing triple cs pretty often. I had tried Vicodin before and after seeing Rue take some lines of oxy I decided to try it out. I had no way to get them so I began going to house parties and raiding peoples medicine cabinets for whatever I could get. One day I was extremely successful and found a full bottle of oxys and hydros and filled my pockets. It got to the point where I would do this at any house I went to and could recognize most prescription medications. This went on for a while but soon my luck ran out and I truly didn’t know how to get more so I had to quit. I filled the void with triple cs because it was the closest thing to it I could find. I ended up going off the deep end after this and have TRIED every drug but crack, dmt, and pcp. I only did heroin once and meth about three times. Did I mention I was 17 at the time? Dropped out, legal troubles, lost two jobs, lost all my non-addict friends, and totaled my car. The whole nine yards!

Flash forward to today I am 8 months sober at 20. At least that’s what everybody thinks. I stopped everything but weed and acid and then stopped acid 3 months in. After this I relapsed on triple cs and did them 2 handfuls of times within a three month period. For the new year I decided to really go on the straight and narrow. Then Euphoria came out.

This show became quite difficult to watch this season because it started to portray the lows of addiction much more than before. And I saw myself heavily in Rue. The only other time I felt this devastated and entranced by a portrayal of addiction was in the film Beautiful Boy. I get quite emotional watching things like this. I think that after the switch from her doing anything she could get(like me back in the day), to finding her drug of choice in heroin and fentanyl, I became terrified of ever going back to that. And know it’s not an option anymore. 

To make a long story short yes if I’m being honest season one did kind of send me into a tailspin-although I acknowledge that I am to blame for my addiction NOT the show. But season two is doing a much better job at showing the hard parts of addiction that come once the honeymoon phase has ended. And I think it was necessary to show the fun parts first.

Where I wasn’t automatically scum that shouldn’t be discussed or highlighted because I’m an addict. An addict in a pretty world. 

But there was nothing pretty about the world I lived in when i was shooting dope. My drug addiction was not as aesthetic lol. Maybe the first couple of times were. Eventually, it became survival. Hours would be spent on the toilet just trying to find a half-ass viable vein to hit because I just  needed  to  get  better.

I’m glad to see more people are saying this show turns them off from drugs, at least opiates and “hard drugs”.. I know when I was using, I used to always get high whenever a character in a show/film was getting high. Yeah I was lame.

I had to look down in embarrassment watching this, because ugh the absolute relatability and seeing how I probably looked when I was the one bashing in my little sister’s door with my doc martens after she found a bag of rigs and ratted me out to my dad.

For real, addiction brought out so many disturbing, terrifying, sad and lonely situations. To anyone that has made it out, you’re a fuxking miracle. For real, you’re a miracle. And if no one has told you they’re proud of you, I am. My soul aches for all the addicts suffering and going through hell right now.

627,"I had my first major hip surgery when I was 12, where the ball of my hip was only hanging in the socket by a tendon so they put 2 screws in my hip to connect it back together. This caused my right side, where I had my surgery, to stop growing while my left side continued to grow causing a right leg length discrepancy of 2 inches. I walked with a limp of over 12 years and at the same time, the screws in my hip began to mesh into the bone and deteriorate. This caused me to need a total hip replacement at age 25 in 2018. Before my hip replacement surgery, I started to have lots of chronic back and neck pain (as well as hip pain) bc I had been walking with a leg length discrepancy of over a decade. It caused me to suffer 2 herniated discs and scoliosis with constant episodes of sciatica. Several days the pain was so extreme that I couldn't get out of bed. I tried every medication under the sun which did nothing to help me and I was finally put on pain meds. Pain medications, like opioids, didn't fully take the pain away, but they allowed me to resume a somewhat normal, functional life again. I have NEVER turned to street drugs like heroin or fentanyl and NEVER WILL. No matter what! 

People who become addicted and turn to street drugs or folks who steal drugs that aren't theirs make it hell for people like me to pick up our meds every 30 days or to get prescribed medications that will allow us to live semi-regular lives again. It's not fair, we didn't ask for this - yet we are treated like criminals simply for seeking pain relief. Thankfully I was lucky enough to find doctors who took my issues seriously enough to prescribe me these medications. However not everyone is as fortunate as I am. Many pain patients end up ending their lives because no doctor will help them so they're forced to live day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year in EXCRUCIATING pain every single day. 

 Whether they know it or not, addicts have irreuputably harmed millions of innocent people and it's undeniably unfair. Chronic pain patients deserve to be able to drive, play with their kids and even go to the grocery store and not have to suffer. Shows like these will only contribute more to talks about the opioid crisis while failing to look at pain patients' perspectives.

I’m on subs now and it’s been a godsend for managing my pain and my cravings. It took me multiple ODs, hospitalizations, inpatient detox, and a few different outpatient programs before something stuck. I didn’t start watching euphoria until I was a few months clean but I was watching a shit ton of intervention and dopesick nation when I got clean this last time. It helped me feel not so alone. Now watching euphoria makes me never ever want to get anywhere near living that way again. I just wanted to tell you that you got this. It was so hard for me to understand the damage the drug abuse was doing to my brain when I was in active addiction, but looking at how I am now, there truly is healing to be found and recovery has been worth it every day even the ones that sucked.

I was on some very strong stuff in the hospital but when I was discharged (on a Friday afternoon unfortunately) whatever they prescribed didn’t even make a dent in my pain levels. They said because of the ‘opioid epidemic’ they didn’t want to send me home with any but I had a broken spine and literally couldn’t move a muscle when I got home and they wore off. My mom spent all weekend calling and begging all the doctors to send a new prescription and then one wrote a script for like over a hundred pills, so definitely overprescribed. One of the asshole doctors asked why I was able to get up and walk at the hospital but was in a wheelchair at a follow up. Thanks a lot dipshit it was because I actually had appropriate drugs at the hospital. The opioids really do make me sick so I’m not going to take them unless I really need them. Every time I’ve had to take them I get to a point where I’d rather deal with the pain than the side effects of the drugs.

It's sort of like how some people can drink and not destroy their life, so it makes it incredibly difficult for someone who tries to stick to one drink and ends up derailing their whole life in one night. It can be hard for a young teen addict to understand why they have to be 100% sober when everyone else seems to be balancing it.

Option B: Rue vaguely told him about wanting to scam a drug dealer that wasn't Fez

Option C: Rue told him *everything* including her intention to kill herself by OD before she had to pay up

None of these options paint him in a good light but they range from approving of a shitty, transparently dangerous idea to encouraging her suicide to her face.

I believe its possible for some people when stable mentally can just not get addicted. Obviously if your unstable mentally theres no amount of perfect genetics that can save you from drugs but some people can do drugs and then end up fine without getting addicted. Like steveo got super addicted to cocaine but he said how he did meth and never got addicted. I think elliot is similiar in that way to where he can legitimately just control it and just simply not do drugs in the same way some people just dont drink to much.

He sees Jules hurt and not feeling desired by Rue and acts impulsively by hooking up with her. He sees Jules hurt after Rue snaps on her in the car, and impulsively tells her Rue's using again. He sees his friend...Jules...hurting and does whatever he can to make her feel better. Again...he is acting impulsively not thinking about the consequences.  And this works to some extent that night.

  
The next day though....he sees the consequences of telling Jules play out. He feels completely responsible for what happened at Rue's house that morning. All of the attacks and all of the pain. If he hadn't opened his mouth, everything would be ""fine"". And the guilt of betraying Rue's trust and ruining her relationship with Jules on top of this is a lot for him to take. 

&#x200B;

so when he says, ""I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING. I LIKED RUE THE WAY THAT SHE WAS. AND THIS SHIT WAS NEVER MY PLACE.""

To me, this line is all about regretting his impulsive behavior. He didn't realize all the implications. He told Jules to comfort her in the moment, and perhaps hook up with her? He didn't realize telling Jules meant looping in Rue's mom and sister and the amount of pain and worry this cause them. He didn't realize this meant exposing a darker side to Rue's addiction -- which is why he makes sure to say he liked her the way that she was (he didn't know or realize she could be like this).

I loved the police chase but instead of the random need to chase a teen through the ends of the Earth because she puked, why not have Rue's mom rightfully get the police involved for the suitcase and bring her trouble with Laurie that way?

359,"I’m a recovering IV meth addict. Five months into my meth addiction, two months into using IV, I started doing heroin/fentanyl as well with my boyfriend, who was a heroin addict (and did meth secondary). I *only*  snorted heroin/fentanyl. Meth was my first love and drug of choice, 100%. I did heroin off and on for about three months and never shot it up. I’m confident that had I started shooting it too, that I wouldn’t have been able to quit as easily as I did and that I would not be here today. My clean date [off all substances/meth] is 07/31/2019 but I haven’t done heroin since 03/05/2018*. 

* The last time I bought heroin in 3/2018: So I was the only person in my “friend” group with a car and my abusive, heroin addict boyfriend had me giving all his other heroin addict buddies rides to the city to cop heroin. They’d pay me $20 total- $10 in gas and $10 in heroin (pills or “beans”). My boyfriend got arrested and I continued to drive his friends down to buy drugs and for the first time since I started using heroin, I’d used daily for the past 17 days after my boyfriend went to jail. So for the first time since I started using it, I got dope sick. I went to visit my boyfriend in jail on a Thursday night and was planning to meet my dealer afterwards to get drugs. My main dealer that I liked, that didn’t use fentanyl, he worked/sold on a schedule, he was a “family man”- he only sold every other day, never on Sundays, didn’t start until noon and didn’t sell past 10pm (so if we got him around 9:30p, he’d just give us whatever he had left- a heroin addicts wet dream). It was after 10pm and I knew he wasn’t coming so I drove all the way home and I was dope sick all weekend. I woke up Sunday feeling better and the first thing I did was call my grandpa, scam $40 out of him and went to the city to get more heroin. This day I went to a new dealer that another buddy had introduced me to. I bought $20 worth and I ended up getting really sick. At first I just thought it was because I hadn’t used in a few days, then I thought I was overdosing. The next morning I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and I burst into tears. I stood there and told myself: if you don’t stop getting high [on heroin], you ***ARE*** going to die. I was already seeing a psychiatrist for depression and I found out my psychiatrist prescribed Suboxone so I called that morning and asked to be seen. They said they didn’t have any openings for two weeks and I started crying and said I was currently using heroin and I’d have to keep using until then and begged them to get me in sooner, she put me on hold, came back and made an appointment for me for that afternoon. That was Monday, March 5, 2018 and that was the last day I ever did heroin. I was on Suboxone for three months and weaned off. On another, much scarier, note- the psychiatrist would do drug tests at every appointment, including the first. At that first appointment, I had Carfentanil in my system, which is why I got so sick that time. If you don’t know what Carfentanil is, it’s used to anesthetize large animals such as elephants and bears. It is typically administered in this context by tranquilizer dart. It’s 10,000 more potent than Morphine and 100 more potent than Fentanyl. It is some **very scary shit**. I thank God every single day that I quit when I did and I didn’t go back to that same dealer. Since being in NA, I’ve buried **so** many people to heroin overdoses, including my three year old daughters father, who died when she was nine months old and never got to meet her.

365,"I disagree. There’s a difference between a social user and an addict and addicts brains are just wired different. 

Elliot could just be “a teenager having fun and partying” every once in a while and his level of use may never get any worse or have any kind of lasting effects or cause any major turmoil in his life. That’s how non-addict brains work. The reason they call it a disease is because an addicts brain, from birth and through development, is wired differently. So perhaps Elliot’s addiction just hasn’t graduated to the level of Rue’s or perhaps Elliot isn’t an addict at all and is fine to socially use, or “party”.

448,"The thing that really sets the scene, what “they” call the gateway drug- it’s not weed or alcohol (though those are often peoples first experiences with drugs). The real gateway to drug abuse is **trauma**. Any and all kind of trauma, which can be different for many people. Add in mental health conditions and genetics (the predisposition to become an addict if you’re parents were also addicted) and someone really has to work hard to *not* use. 

I didn’t start until I was 33 years old. I’d experimented with acid, mushrooms, smoked a little weed when I was younger, even did anhydrous meth (very different from the “ice” I started using and got addicted to when I was 33) a few times in my younger days. I never used excessively or daily and it never went too far. Was even a regular drinker in my early to mid 20’s, never had any issues with that. I don’t know anything about my fathers side but my mothers side, including my mother, is full of addiction. My mother was an alcoholic, addicted to many different prescription drugs and cocaine caused a lot of problems in her life as well. Both of my younger sisters are pretty hardcore alcoholics and I was just keenly aware of the fact that I needed to be careful in my lifetime with any and all substances and I went to college and started working in the field right out of college. It wasn’t until I was so desperate to “fix” and rescue my now ex husband, who’d been using and selling meth for a year while we were separated, that I snorted a line once after I’d been drinking one night back in 2017, the night he came home, and that started my personal hell.

464,"IV use sends the drug directly through your bloodstream so it hits you so much faster. Not only that but most IV drugs addicts literally get addicted to the needle as well. I’m a recovering IV meth addict and I’ve heard so many people say they’ve shot up really random things, not even drugs, just to feel the needle in their bodies. I know how crazy that sounds but it’s true. 

Also, IV use, because it hits you faster, all at once, there’s a higher chance of overdosing and dying. Also, using needles puts you at higher risk of contracting HIV, Hepatitis and other infections, as well as developing deadly infections from missing (when your drugs don’t shoot into the vein), sharing needles, getting bad batches and shooting other things, or using dirty water (or not water at all). There’s also a risk of getting “cotton fever”, which happens when bacteria is injected into the body, often caused by the cotton from a q-tip, cotton ball or the butt of a cigarette, which are used in the process of shooting up.",Lollyadverb1984,9,1644296968.0,hw1nkad,sn2vpk

4,"I agree 1000000000% with OP. This is absolutely the best portrayal of opiate withdrawal.  It wasnt triggering for me, but if I was new to recovery and treatment, I don’t know how I would react. This is a  reality that needs to be shown. It’s a special kind of hell no one should ever have to go through. 

I wish Rue’s mom hadn’t lied to her about going to rehab. I would’ve taken her to the ER to get started on curbing the withdrawals, and then taken her to the methadone clinic to get her started on bupes or methadone. Not only are withdrawals dangerous, but most importantly, they are torture. That is just the physical. It’s the mind stuff that happens later that can ruin a person.  Even if the physical symptoms have gone, no one tells you about the mind fuck you get every day.  Some fall into a deep depression, some become manic, needing to apologize to everyone who has ever interacted with them in a negative way,and some just have really loud inner monologues reminding them of every thing and every one they have ever done wrong. The best way I can describe the mind fuck is this: when you can’t fall asleep at night because you are thinking about every time you were embarrassed in front of the whole class for whatever reason, or all the cringey photos and videos of you in junior high or high school. Like that, but constant rotation, and then put the cramping, puking, diarrhea, yawning, sweating, sniffling, and general malaise of badness together, and then the circle of awfulness is complete. 

Stay safe, friends. OP, hope you are having a great day, and thanks for talking about this, because too many are uneducated about the harm opiates can do to a person’s brain and body, and their friends and family. 🖤",Chiraltrash,73,1644269656.0,hvzxevw,smur2x

It’s mind boggling that she hit every detail emotionally and physically, even little things like hunching forward with her arms crossed at Cassies house, the yawning, the shaking. The film work and production was great too. How she would zone out into her own pain while Laurie was talking about cell death in opioid addicts. The shot would be unfocused when she’s looking at the microwave as if she was looking through it. She’s hearing Laurie talk but she’s not hearing her talk. Everything is distorted background noise outside of her physical and mental anguish. Withdrawals aren’t just terrible physically, but they exacerbate depression and anxiety as well.

Also I could really feel the raw anger towards her mom and Jules when she found out the drugs had been flushed and the fear of realizing she’s about to start going through withdrawal, that scene was Oscar worthy.

I did shit like Rue did on a lesser level – for example, screaming when my pills were gone, stealing pills from family, and once i even kicked a hole in my bedroom wall when my mom decided to put my pills in a safe (one of the worst things I’ve ever done). It triggered the memories of lying in agony yawning, sneezing, feeling like I had the worst flu in the world, throwing up, nose running, wanting to literally d*e because i felt death was preferable to withdrawal. Sobbing in the bathtub (which was my only place of solace) wondering how fucked my life had become.

holy hell, this. The fear of opiate withdrawal is something I can’t even put into words. Opiates fuck with you so badly that it makes you say shit and do shit that otherwise you’d never do. At one point, it stops being about the high and starts being about just doing fucking anything to avoid that withdrawal. I cannot express how fucking TERRIFYING it is for an addict to realize they’re facing down withdrawal, hence the anger. Rue’s anger and cruelty weren’t justified, but hell if I didn’t see a little bit where she was coming from having lived through it. (She was awful to her poor mother and poor sister and Jules, tho.) She felt like the rug had been ripped out from under her and she could only register what her loved ones were doing as “betrayal” and it translated as anger.

136,"Id rather switch brains to be honest. 

Physical withdrawals is literal hell for 1-4 weeks, depending on if you were smart and CT of heroin or something, or dumb enough like me to CT of methadone/bupe. 
But its still the lesser evil. 

The real evil is PAWs and the fucking depression that causes most of us to start selfmedicating in the first place. 

Getting addicted must look hilariously stupid from the outside, even though in a lot of cases, its almost a rational decision. 

I didnt function before opioids, I was suicidal and miserable, anhedonic, fatigued and couldn't rely on anything to make me happy. 
Opioids gave the the guarantee to feel happy for atleast once a week, regardless of usage pattern. Im not exactly in a better place, and still miserable as fuck because of the opioids now, but its all worth it for the guarantee that for just a few hours a week ill be happy.

I literally prefer active addiction to the depression I was in before, even though my family and girlfriend does not, which is understandable because my addiction makes my misery their problem aswell, before I had to suffer for myself. 

Tried quitting like 6 times so far but the depression always comes back and makes me use again. During WDs I swear to never use again, and once the Paws hits, once the depression hits, I swear to never attempt to be sober again, regardless for what reason, to save relationships, my longterm health or myth of my functionality, and order drugs as fast as I can. 

While a selfish part of me wishes everyone atleast once experience longterm treatment resistant depression, so they could empathise with my absolute lack of choice in the matter, that would also kill society and cause an insane amount of suffering, and I do not with my suffering on other people, better they remain ignorant and judgemental.",LowOnDopamine,1,1648430388.0,i2dtp9p,smur2x

139,"a few things, but mainly, from my personal experience: having personally been a brown/dark-skinned teenage girl as well at the time i was an addict who had a couple encounters with cops when high or going thru withdrawals, i don’t think things like the situation with the police would ever have happened. they probably would’ve shot me. i was always very cooperative and respectful to police because i was raised to know that there’s a much bigger chance they’ll shoot me than, say, my blonde best friend or my white bf. i know Rue’s feeling like straight-up su*cidal, but damn if those cops didn’t let her continually wreak havoc in a bit of an unrealistic way. i’m not saying that everything has to show race or whatever and a lot of the times i actually appreciate the race-blind-seeming writing in the show, but an appreciated addition probably would’ve been at least some sort of acknowledgment from Rue that she’s a black girl running from the cops. kind of same with her breaking into that random couple’s home who had a gun. idk how to explain it bc POC are not a monolith but it just didn’t feel like she was taking into account the consequences that a biracial black girl (who looks as obviously messed up as she does, at that) could face. there are other times when Rue has acted in ways that have made me feel that way and i totally get if Sam doesn’t want to touch that issue but at the same time it is a bit noticeable. i hope this made sense, i’m super tired from work atm lol

The only time I ever experienced brutal withdrawals was when my boyfriend went to detox and i decided to do it at home with my moms help. i was sleeping a lot and didnt keep track of the time, so I took subs way too earlier than i was supposed to because i thought a full day had passed when it had not, i ended up taking subs maybe 5-6 hours after my last dose and obviously went into full blown precipitated withdrawals. i dont remember it but my mom said i was a demon. it subsided after 24-36 hrs though. i feel like my precipitated WD experience is akin to what most people go through in normal WDs. My system is weird; I took 2 mg of xanax daily for like 7 years(prescribed) and stopped for a week when i was pregnant and figuring out how i was going to go forward...and i surprisingly had little if any wd symptoms.

206,"I gotta run and hit a meeting so I can’t reply to everything, but I do want to say I’m glad you are okay after the overdoses and that you and him are in a good place now. :) 

But I do completely understand that push and pull between wanting to use and knowing you shouldn’t.",thousanddays234,5,1644273139.0,hw065fn,smur2x
207,Yawns usually the first sign ur goin into withdrawals that starts before everything gets bad not sure why but it does....,sHauNm525,10,1644281944.0,hw0qryk,smur2x
208,I used to do it there no possible way you'll hit a Vien up and down like that...and for someone only doin it once it's not gonna leave a big mark I get that whole situation but it was not realistic for someone that doesn't shoot....maybe if she's been doin it for years and her arms scarred up that's about it tho,sHauNm525,1,1644594894.0,hwin6gc,smur2x
209,I know this comment is old as heck but in the scene where Laurie stabs the needle thru Rue’s arm there’s literally a visible vein on the right side of the needle (the cephalic vein) she could’ve gone for.,shiveringnetherrack,1,1647214887.0,i0jy3mq,smur2x

211,"In my opinion, without a doubt. Being a junkie, especially one with track marks makes you undesirable to people around you. Once you start abusing drugs that way, you isolate everyone in your life (e.g., family and friends) and all you have now is the people who you do drugs with and the dealer themselves. I think thats why laurie said she knew rue was going to be in her life for a while.",ProleteriatWillRise,2,1644354320.0,hw4u7p0,smur2x
212,"Yeah, I took it as a way to make it hard for Rue to go back to her family/friends, because they would see that and have issues with it. So it made it more likely that Rue has nowhere to go *except* Laurie, making it more likely she comes back even if she does manage to escape.",LookInTheDog,1,1644485751.0,hwcjbz5,smur2x
213,It seems like making it visible would make that aspect more complicated for Laurie is all I'm saying.,nehzun,1,1644355452.0,hw4xbj1,smur2x
214,I think she made the track marks so that if Rue died that night then the police would notice there was no track marks thus pointing to she wasn’t actually a user and someone maybe did this to her for her first time.
