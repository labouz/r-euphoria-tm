13,"watching rue in each episode feels like i’m watching my younger sister — we haven’t talked in over 5 years. she’s an addict, beholden to opiates, amphetamines, and anything else in between. our parents were meth addicts and alcoholics, and we had oppositional reactions; i’ve never tried any drugs, and she tried them all. she became addicted, and i resented her for it. i tried to force sobriety into her via shame and she pushed back into it further. then we lost each other. 

this last episode hit me harder than anything else i’ve watched, ever. 

i’m older now, and i wonder what could’ve been with our relationship had i been able to forgive her for the illness she was inflicted with involuntarily, instead of seeing her actions as selfish choices, as re-traumatizing me and betraying our bond. i wonder what an honest and open approach could’ve looked like. i wonder about where she is. i wonder about if i find out she’s died, or if she will pull herself out of this. i wonder about what it’s like to have a sister again. 

the core question: does euphoria make me want to try drugs? no. nothing could make me want to try drugs. but it makes me see my past interactions in a different light. it makes me want to push to be more compassionate towards addiction.",ambientscreaming,54,1644657313.0,hwmidci

I know that I probably should stop watching all together, especially since this topic is so easy to trigger me but it's such a great show and I have fomo.

With that being said, I hope it scares the shit out of anyone who is even slightly curious about opiates. I always told myself that I would never try heroin bc I knew I would like it. I was clean for 3 years. I had a bad week and was originally looking for Lortabs. My friend made me believe that's what we were getting but when he got back in the car, it wasn't Lortabs.

I've been in relationships with people like Rue. Who talked to me the exact way she talked to Jules and her mom and sister. I truly think Euphoria, at least with Rues story, is extremely accurate.

51,"Recovering addict here, and I’ve never related more/ seen a better portrayal of the life of an addict than rue in euphoria, it’s really hard to know if you have an addictive personality and if having fun w friends or experimenting w drugs is going to take a hold of you and run your life into the ground until it’s much too late, I was a 3.8 student and got into weed my senior year then moved onto to psychedelics, trying coke and molly then shortly after became hooked on Xanax and then ultimately moved on to opiates and a oxy/ Percocet habit is incredibly expensive and that’s why a majority of opiate users move on to heroin/ fentanyl which is what happened to me, I spent every waking moment focused on getting high and stopped caring about literally anything besides drugs, and once you have a dependence on opiates it’s literally a physical need stronger than the need to eat food or drink water, you’ll do almost anything to avoid withdrawal and it will lead to living a life that is pure hell, when your going through withdrawal your brain thinks your body is dying and the feeling is unlike any pain you can imagine until you’ve been through it, if anyone reading this is considering trying any type of opiate just don’t fucking do it, the truth is that it will feel better than ANYTHING you’ve ever felt before and it will most likely take a hold of you, don’t be like me and think that from past experiences and ego that u can “handle ur drugs” or that ur stronger than it, ur not stronger than opiates and no one is, it won’t be like anything you’ve ever felt and it will take you and turn you into a fiend and a sorry excuse for a person that you and everyone you care about will hate. Living while addicted to opiates is like living with a noose around ur neck that gets tighter everytime you don’t have them and it’s unbearable.

I was in a toxic and emotionally abusive relationship too and it was just a nightmare. I literally have to pause and take breaks in between scenes like it’s too real sometimes

Watching her habits and seeing how her addiction is bringing out the absolute worst in her has really helped me not get back into that stuff cause I know if I start I won’t stop.

423,"Warning to those that do enjoy opiates. Been an addict for over 15 years. ONLY messed around with pills. Never fucked with heroin or tin foil and only ever swallowed or snorted my pills. Always was able to walk away and either take subs for a short time or just stop. Literally did this for 15 years. 

Pandemic hits. No more pills. Good friend/dealer (oxymoronic I kno) tells me about fent and I can just snort like blow. I’m like alright I mean it’s a pharmaceutical and not H. Got a few bags and did lil pinch lines. After a month get on subs within a day of stopping. All good. Get over taking subs and think I’ll do f again and till subs are out of my system then detox the subs for a few days. This time I actually get really into it and actually start nodding out on it(never ever nodded out prior to this except on methadone when went to the clinic for only a month and hated nodding). I actually love nodding out on this stuff it’s so fun. 

First 2 months are fucking awesome I’m on top of the world I feel so amazing and happy. 3rd month: alright gotta nip this in the bud I’m too into it and gotta get my job back. 

First 24 hrs off fent: hah this shit is easy as fuck barely feel any withdrawals.. ok guess it’s been 24 hrs gonna take a 2mg sub… hmm doesn’t do anything. Guess I need more. After 6 mg start feelin really shitty. Probably not enough and am really withdrawing now. Proceed to take 24 MG(please don’t ever do this). Almost die and start hallucinating I am trapped in a castle that is a part of hell and I am being held down by demons while it’s 200 degrees and I’m sweating, can’t stay still, my body feels like I’m being skinned alive over and over again. I start rolling around in my bed spitting on myself convulsing. Do this for about 10 hours. Bf comes home with a bag(he hasn’t quit yet) and after 12 hours of this I’m practically done but I am so fucking sore so I break down and start snorting lines. After 5 to 6 good sized lines I finally feel so much better and normal. Takes 5 days for all that sub to leave my body. 

Took me an entire year after that to get the balls to get into the methadone clinic. I’m almost 4 months clean and my birthday is this Sunday. I feel so much better. Fentanyl is no joke. I did almost overdose once and can tell you all about that or other stories if you want. 

Please beware. I ALWAYS carried narcan with me and sadly I did have to use it on my own mother (she is an addict to ; a huge reason I got into pills(she gave me them everyday since I was 14). 

I have missed so many things in life due to drugs. I am currently in the car while my bf drives us to the clinic as I write this. Love all you guys and please be smart and stay safe.",RiiniiUsagii,1,1644688338.0,hwo69ws

495,"When the first season came out I was already addicted to weed(I know it’s not physically addictive but I have an addictive personality)and had been doing triple cs pretty often. I had tried Vicodin before and after seeing Rue take some lines of oxy I decided to try it out. I had no way to get them so I began going to house parties and raiding peoples medicine cabinets for whatever I could get. One day I was extremely successful and found a full bottle of oxys and hydros and filled my pockets. It got to the point where I would do this at any house I went to and could recognize most prescription medications. This went on for a while but soon my luck ran out and I truly didn’t know how to get more so I had to quit. I filled the void with triple cs because it was the closest thing to it I could find. I ended up going off the deep end after this and have TRIED every drug but crack, dmt, and pcp. I only did heroin once and meth about three times. Did I mention I was 17 at the time? Dropped out, legal troubles, lost two jobs, lost all my non-addict friends, and totaled my car. The whole nine yards!

Flash forward to today I am 8 months sober at 20. At least that’s what everybody thinks. I stopped everything but weed and acid and then stopped acid 3 months in. After this I relapsed on triple cs and did them 2 handfuls of times within a three month period. For the new year I decided to really go on the straight and narrow. Then Euphoria came out.

This show became quite difficult to watch this season because it started to portray the lows of addiction much more than before. And I saw myself heavily in Rue. The only other time I felt this devastated and entranced by a portrayal of addiction was in the film Beautiful Boy. I get quite emotional watching things like this. I think that after the switch from her doing anything she could get(like me back in the day), to finding her drug of choice in heroin and fentanyl, I became terrified of ever going back to that. And know it’s not an option anymore. 

To make a long story short yes if I’m being honest season one did kind of send me into a tailspin-although I acknowledge that I am to blame for my addiction NOT the show. But season two is doing a much better job at showing the hard parts of addiction that come once the honeymoon phase has ended. And I think it was necessary to show the fun parts first.

My mom was a heroin user in the early 70s got hepatitis C from it, she got clean,  went to law school and became a judge and then she relapsed when I was in high school lately it's been really really bad she's been getting really high on methadone and a bunch of other drugs. I am picking up Narcan from thenknogarmsd because she don't always answer her door and sometimes I wonder if she's laying in there.

612,"I’m a fan of the show. Sometimes certain scenes make me feel like popping a bar and grooving… just cause it’s all so, pretty. I imagine a world where I actually have friends. Where I wasn’t automatically scum that shouldn’t be discussed or highlighted because I’m an addict. An addict in a pretty world. 

But there was nothing pretty about the world I lived in when i was shooting dope. My drug addiction was not as aesthetic lol. Maybe the first couple of times were. Eventually, it became survival. Hours would be spent on the toilet just trying to find a half-ass viable vein to hit because I just  needed  to  get  better. (I’m 2 years free from H and I still have no veins and need PICS for an IV fluids, medications, etc yay!)

I’m glad to see more people are saying this show turns them off from drugs, at least opiates and “hard drugs”.. I know when I was using, I used to always get high whenever a character in a show/film was getting high. Yeah I was lame. 

Some scenes show a glimpse of real shit, like Rue freaking out about the suitcase, kicking the door down. I had to look down in embarrassment watching this, because ugh the absolute relatability and seeing how I probably looked when I was the one bashing in my little sister’s door with my doc martens after she found a bag of rigs and ratted me out to my dad.

For real, addiction brought out so many disturbing, terrifying, sad and lonely situations. To anyone that has made it out, you’re a fuxking miracle. For real, you’re a miracle. And if no one has told you they’re proud of you, I am. My soul aches for all the addicts suffering and going through hell right now. To anyone who thinks this lifestyle looks appealing, you’ll probably scoff at me saying this but it will destroy you. In one way or another, it will take something. Your innocence, a friend, your hope, your ambition, your goals, your health, your career, family, life… you name it, addiction will take it, throw it into the flames and make you fan them.",milfsteak,1,1644906181.0,hx07nj7

627,"I had my first major hip surgery when I was 12, where the ball of my hip was only hanging in the socket by a tendon so they put 2 screws in my hip to connect it back together. This caused my right side, where I had my surgery, to stop growing while my left side continued to grow causing a right leg length discrepancy of 2 inches. I walked with a limp of over 12 years and at the same time, the screws in my hip began to mesh into the bone and deteriorate. This caused me to need a total hip replacement at age 25 in 2018. Before my hip replacement surgery, I started to have lots of chronic back and neck pain (as well as hip pain) bc I had been walking with a leg length discrepancy of over a decade. It caused me to suffer 2 herniated discs and scoliosis with constant episodes of sciatica. Several days the pain was so extreme that I couldn't get out of bed. I tried every medication under the sun which did nothing to help me and I was finally put on pain meds. Pain medications, like opioids, didn't fully take the pain away, but they allowed me to resume a somewhat normal, functional life again. I have NEVER turned to street drugs like heroin or fentanyl and NEVER WILL. No matter what! 

People who become addicted and turn to street drugs or folks who steal drugs that aren't theirs make it hell for people like me to pick up our meds every 30 days or to get prescribed medications that will allow us to live semi-regular lives again. It's not fair, we didn't ask for this - yet we are treated like criminals simply for seeking pain relief. Thankfully I was lucky enough to find doctors who took my issues seriously enough to prescribe me these medications. However not everyone is as fortunate as I am. Many pain patients end up ending their lives because no doctor will help them so they're forced to live day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year in EXCRUCIATING pain every single day. 

 Whether they know it or not, addicts have irreuputably harmed millions of innocent people and it's undeniably unfair. Chronic pain patients deserve to be able to drive, play with their kids and even go to the grocery store and not have to suffer. Shows like these will only contribute more to talks about the opioid crisis while failing to look at pain patients' perspectives. Don't get me wrong, I love the show, I just wish there were people looking out for people like me.",throwaway3million47,0,1644691077.0,hwoczgy

Vaping is better than smoking but the science has yet to mature and the bits we have gleaned aren't very promising. Generally anything in your lungs besides air is subpar for your health.

EDIT: Just to make it clear, I do not support vaping, I don't believe you should do it except *maybe* if you're using it to kick smoking, I'm not sure though if vaping genuinely helps with that though. Smoking is bad, and according to the science I've seen, vaping is bad but less bad than smoking; if anyone has science to combat that genuinely please share it with me.

I’m on subs now and it’s been a godsend for managing my pain and my cravings.

I didn’t start watching euphoria until I was a few months clean but I was watching a shit ton of intervention and dopesick nation when I got clean this last time. It helped me feel not so alone. Now watching euphoria makes me never ever want to get anywhere near living that way again. I just wanted to tell you that you got this.

I’ve had plenty of cocaine in my life but I’m not addicted either. It really depends on if you have trauma that you are hoping to be able to escape that determines if you become an addict.
