1,remember that scene in season 2 episode 6 when rue bennett is on the bed crying due to her suffering from the drugs had been taking through out the entire show and her sister was comforting her?,The reason why i ask yall is because if yall were in that scene in the room with them right now would you sing a song to rue to make her feel better because if so what would yall sing to her? because if i knew how to sing I would sing either breaking the habit by linkin park or the acoustic version of this is what it feels like by armin van buuren and trevor guthrie.,https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/vg41db/remember_that_scene_in_season_2_episode_6_when/,vg41db,Cautious_Potential_8,13,1655670953.0,0.66,11
2,I think it's messed up Lexi's pursuing Rues drug dealer and enabler,"If anyone saw the ravages of drug abuse in Rue it was Lexi. Doesn't she know that Fez was giving Rue drugs? The fact that he stopped giving her drugs at some point doesn't mean shit, btw, because she's already hooked (or idk the narrative in season two was messy- she just like quits apparently for the whole school year, nothing having actually changed in her life, its implied she goes to school on Suboxone which is super weird, and they totally gloss over the whole mental illness part of sobriety (in the second season)). 

You remember the way Laurie just kinda let's Rue leave? My guess is that after having given her the morphine intravenously she's not worried about rue leaving because she knows shes gonna come back, somehow, eventually, for more morphine. Obviously that's not how real life drug dealers operate, but it proves the point that there aren't any morally superior drug dealers, whether they're your friend or not. You don't know who's an addict and who's not, who's got the gene and who doesn't. For some, that first high is the end of everything. And Rue is one of them. So how would Lexi justify this to herself? He's hot?? I agree that Rue would have ended up using whether fez provided them or not, but Fez is providing her. And drug dealing is the perfect business : selling a perfect product takes no effort, it sells itself. In the end, for a long time, fez would profit from his friends addiction. 

Literally just wanted to write this out from the perspective of an addict who also thought that my friend/drug dealer wasn't that bad. But they were. And people are really giving Lexi some kind of moral high ground when, in my opinion, if anything had happened between Lexi and fez, I'd see that as a deeper betrayal than Cassie sleeping w Maddy's ex. And the show doesn't even recognise any of this as problematic. I really hope there comes a moment in season 3 where rue burns bridges with people for her sobriety. Not only would that be an interesting new dynamic, but it would also be more representative of what they teach you in NA

Edit: this got a lot of traction, I just wanted to say that I don't think that if you're a felon or if you've committed crimes that you're necessarily bad, that's not what I meant to say and I'm sorry if it came off that way. I understand class struggle and poverty which leads to crime. I wanted to highlight the drug dealer + addict friendship dynamic because I feel thats when things can get really messy and the show kinda glosses over that.

Since this post is still getting more attention, I wanted to summarize what I meant: in real life, it is RARE that your drug dealer friend actually has your best interest in mind. The show is kinda saying ""you can be an addict who is friends w a drug dealer and it can still be an all round healthy and beneficial friendship"" which is not accurate all the time with real life addicts who probably would not be able to dissociate the drugs from the friend. In season one Rue even relies on him to ""spot"" her when she has no money, and that makes me think of the whole time they were friends off screen before season 1, when she'd buy drugs more and more from him over time. Did alarm bells not start ringing then and there? Its not like she bought weed from him once and then on she was an addict: there was a gradual build up. I think if he were really her friend, he would have stopped her on the day he said that ""drugs weren't the solution"" like literally in season 1 episode 1.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/uy87z3/i_think_its_messed_up_lexis_pursuing_rues_drug/,uy87z3,Just_Ad3943,267,1653573457.0,0.7,132
3,I think the portrayal and conversation around drugs in this show is pretty accurate.,"I am not necessarily talking about Ashtray being 13and selling drugs or the excessive partying. But when I heard Rue talking about being high in the first episode as ""the world went silent and I felt safe inside my own head"", I was struck. This hit home. I always heard Euphoria as glamorizing drug addiction but I wanted to give it a shot by myself. 

And these are the words that I've been searching for to describe being high for a long, long time.
As Rue, I've always had panic attacks and neurological disorders. Same as Rue the ""Euphoria"" of drugs is also the feeling I've been searching for, for as long as I can remember. 

I've been on Adderall, Weed, Lean, assortment of prescriptions, before moving on to harder drugs. I'll never ever forget the first I took MDMA, it gave me that feeling. I could never forget how I felt when I tried it on for the first time. After that and a couple of blunts, I started to not see, not think...its just silence. Felt like it heightened my emotions but only the ones I wanted.

I think the glamor comes from the show in itself. The lightings, the acting, the outfits, makeup and relationships even the toxic ones. But Sam Levinson's writing about drugs is still memorable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/ur840a/i_think_the_portrayal_and_conversation_around/,ur840a,heartlessloft,200,1652740829.0,0.99,30
4,"Do you guys actually think that the way this show portrays drug use is accurate at all, especially when these characters are supposed to be in high school?","It's never explicitly stated where this show is supposed to take place but my first assumption was that it was just somewhere near L.A. but after watching the show, it's hard to say. There isn’t a ton of gang violence, or any type of violence to any degree that isn’t directly related to the acquisition or selling of drugs and the neighborhood the characters are shown to be in is very suburb-y and don’t fit in the “L.A. aesthetic” that's typical in shows portraying the same constructs. I'm just saying that most other shows where drugs are a huge part of it are based around that area because it's known for that type of activity but, if Euphoria isn't based in LA it's very hard to say whether or not they meant for the show to be realistic or not. Maybe I’m just being biased and ignorant from the way and where I grew up, but I don’t see some of the things happening to the degree it does in this show, especially with the ages of the characters and the lives they live outside of the drugs and chaos.",https://www.reddit.com/r/euphoria/comments/ura6vw/do_you_guys_actually_think_that_the_way_this_show/,ura6vw,Klewlis12,5,1652747360.0,0.67,23
5,i think cassie was on drugs this sequence. my guess is sometime during the play she did something in the bathroom. i wouldnt be surprised to see cassie become the next person doing heavy drugs while rue is sober.,,https://i.redd.it/tedd6c90tix81.jpg,uig0su,Hotchipsandpepsi,0,1651696778.0,0.46,13
6,I love the nuance of this scene in just 30ish seconds. The way Rue’s bluff shatters and she connects dots so quickly to realize Leslie really DID know about the drugs was good writing tbh,,https://v.redd.it/bi3gg3mytqw81,ufm0wl,mooninthewoods,523,1651358851.0,1.0,20
